PREFACE



    The study Communications and Information Technologies and Older Adults
was conducted in co-operation with One Voice - The Canadian Seniors Network
and the Centre for Information Technologies Innovation (CITI) under its
Research Initiatives Program.

    The purpose of this report is to present data, analyses, recommendations
and documents collected between January and June 1993.

    This is a reference document intended for readers wishing further
details on material contained in the research summary published in
February 1994.


The Centre for Information Technologies Innovation (CITI) at Industry Canada

    CITI's mission is to promote the development and dissemination of
information technology applications that improve the performance of
individuals and the competitiveness of organizations working together across
time and distance, through the computerization of their collaborative
processes.

    CITI's Technology and Society team is concerned with the development and
application of new information and communications technologies that improve
access, for persons with disabilities and older adults, to the normal
activities of daily life:  education, work and leisure.  Therefore, the
program focusses primarily on individuals for whom communications services
or technology-based tools and techniques represent the key to equality and
independance.  The program is designed to take account of the interests,
characteristics and needs of users and the professionals who care for them.


    All projects conducted under this program are designed to foster
partnership between the industry, research and development professionals,
organizations representing target clienteles and the university community,
and encourage co-operation between professionals concerned with improving
the quality of life and social integration of older adults and the
handicapped.

    By working in partnership, CITI and One Voice - The Canadian Seniors
Network were able to harmonize their common objectives and interests and
combine the former's expertise in technological innovation and scientific
research with the latter's in-depth understanding of older adults and their
networks.


One Voice - The Canadian Seniors Network

    One Voice - The Canadian Seniors Network promotes the enhancement of the
status and independence of older Canadians.  The organization advocates
policies and programs to improve the well-being of Canadian seniors and
encourages and enables their full and active participation in decisions
affecting their lives.  It is a non-partisan, voluntary, not-for-profit
organization working in both of Canada's official languages, providing
leadership and working in partnership and consultation with others.

1.  INTRODUCTION



    This study examines the interaction between communication and
information technologies (CITs) and older adults.  Its purpose is to describe
the basic tenets of gerontechnology; assess the impact of technology on
specific groups of older adults; and determine the requirements and interests
of Canadians conducting research and development in this area.

    Canada, like other industrialized countries, cannot avoid the two
phenomena that will mark the history of the 20th century and determine the
profile of the 21st, namely, an aging population and technological
development.  All changes brought about by CITs will have an increasingly
important impact on older Canadians.

    The study has reviewed all relevant Canadian and international data,
interviews, opinions and research dealing comprehensively with issues
related to possible interactions between older adults and CITs.

    It has also devoted particular attention to determining priorities for
both research and development and technology marketing.










Problem

    As the phenomenon of technology development continues to unfold,
communications and information technologies have come to play a critical role
in late 20th-century Canadian life.  These technologies are increasingly
ubiquitous in the home, at work and in recreational activities.  They make the
activities of daily life easier for some people but more difficult for others. 
Commercially available technology-based tools are usually designed for broad
segments of the productive population and are not necessarily appropriate for
all groups.  Modern consumers of all ages realize, however, that
technological developments are slowly transforming their lifestyle whether
they like it or not.

    At the same time, the population includes increasing numbers of
individuals aged 55 years and over who, because they are getting older,
experience changes involving functional, sensory and cognitive limitations. 
Furthermore, the trend toward earlier retirement leads to major changes in
social status.  The appearance of these generations of older adults calls for
a re-appraisal of the role of senior citizens in society and the tools that
they may require.

    The convergence of these two phenomena raises several issues and
suggests a number of questions.  For example:  How do seniors react to
technology?  Can technology make it easier to maintain or improve older
Canadians' quality of life?  Is it true that older adults are afraid of
technology?  Is the technology industry prepared to adapt to the needs and
interests of this new clientele?  What, if anything, do seniors' associations
and groups need with respect to technology?

    Not surprisingly, the need for a study of this kind has been recognized
for some years.  Seniors themselves, through One Voice - The Canadian Seniors
Network, have expressed a desire for accurate information on this topic.

Goals and objectives

    To establish the need for a Canadian program of technological
    development designed to encourage older adults to participate in
    society in such a way that the value of their experience, knowledge and
    skills is recognized.

    To discover mechanisms for finding efficient means, using CITs, for
    satisfying the health, economic and information needs of older adults.

Significance of the study

    Even though CITs are present in all aspects of daily life, no study of
this kind has ever been conducted in Canada or elsewhere.  This research is
therefore quite pertinent, to present and future seniors as well as to
industry and government.

    Given that a growing part of the population is made up of older adults,
that these people remain active longer and that more and more of them are
likely to use various high-technology equipment, the time has come to
separate myth from reality regarding seniors and technology.

    Finally, this research may serve as a point of departure for
discussions on gerontechnology among the various stakeholders (seniors
themselves, the CIT industry and research and development centres).  Such
co-operation will encourage associations, government and the private sector
to share research and development responsibilities and costs.

    Ultimately, by facilitating interactions between older adults and
technological applications, society as a whole stands to benefit from the
potential and energy of older Canadians who want to feel useful in their
community.

Principal stakeholders

    Consequently, this study holds potential interest for a variety of
stakeholders and researchers:
    older adults;
    equipment designers;
    service providers;
    manufacturers;
    researchers;
    governments;
    universities;
    municipalities;
    the building, electronics, computer and telecommunications
    industries;
        others.

2.  RESEARCH METHODOLOGY



2.1.     Research design

    The study was conducted between January and June, 1993.  It was designed
to simultaneously explore five research avenues:
    a portrait of the clientele (characteristics, statistics, etc.);
    a review of the literature;
    an inventory of existing or emerging technologies or services in the
    industry;
    a survey of experience in seniors' networks;
    consultations with seniors.

    Various methodological approaches were used, in keeping with the
objective of each stage of the study:  a literature survey, identification of
technologies, an inventory of research and development and consultations
with older adults and industry.




3.  PORTRAIT OF SENIOR CITIZENS



3.1.     Who are these people?

    At what age does one get old?  When does one become a senior citizen?

    The answer to the first questions is very subjective; more often than
not, an individual's psychological age, not biological age, is the
determining factor.  While some individuals under 45 display attitudes and
behaviours generally thought of as typical of older people, others aged
75 years or older engage in activities similar to those of younger people and
think largely as they do.  Since old-age pensions and most retirement plans
take effect at 65 years, however, the answer to the second question depends on
biological age.

    On average, people retire after 62 years of age.  They are eligible for
golden age clubs at age 55 (in some cases, at age 50).  Finally, older adults
gain access to certain free or reduced-fee services based on their
chronological age, not their needs.

    Furthermore, to follow the aging profile of the baby-boomers,
Statistics Canada has established the 45-65 year group; this makes it even
more difficult to break out data on this group.

    Nonetheless, most researchers seem to have adopted the following
categories:
    45 to 65 years:  older adults (which could include older workers,
    pre-retirees or young retirees);
    65 to 75 years:  young-old people;
    80 years and older:  old-old people.


3.2.     What groupings are most appropriate?

    In addition to age, there are other ways to group older adults:  by
cohort, degree of autonomy, place of residence, occupation, social or
political involvement, field of interest, recreational pursuits, etc.

    Importantly, however, with the arrival of new generations of older
adults at the beginning of the next millennium, it is becoming increasingly
difficult to generalize and consider this entire population as a single
group.

3.3.     What are their socio-demographic characteristics in Canada?

3.3.1.   Breakdown by age group

    According to Statistics Canada, in 1993 there were 27,296,860 people
living in Canada and one Canadian out of five (20.4%) was 55 years of age or
older.  This group of 5,569,600 individuals could be broken down as follows:



     55 - 59 years       1,222,925

     60 - 64 years       1,176,705



               8.8%



     65 - 74 years       1,895,070

     75 years and over        1,274,900



               11.6%


    Interestingly, 94,000 Canadian seniors were 90 years of age or older
in 1991.

3.3.2.   Breakdown by sex

    According to Statistics Canada data, the female:male ratio tends to
increase considerably with advancing age.
    49.2% of people between 45 and 64 years of age are women;
    57% of people between 65 and 69 years of age are women.

3.3.3.   Breakdown by ethnic group

    According to 1981 data, about one senior Canadian in six was born
outside of Canada.  Britain and France were the countries of origin for 80% of
these individuals; 17% belonged to the Jewish Community.

    In 1987, 40% of all elderly immigrants came from Great Britain, the
United States, India and the Philippines.  More recent trends in immigration,
however, are causing this proportion to change.

3.3.4.   Life expectancy

    The average life expectancy for a Canadian male at birth is 73.1 years;
for Canadian women, this figure is 79.7 years.  The life expectancy of a
65-year-old man is 14.9 years (for an expected life of almost 80 years); that
of a 65-year-old woman is 19.1 years (for an expected life of 84.1 years).






3.3.5.   Health status

    Most older adults claim to be in excellent or good health.  This
favourable perception declines with age:  71 to 75% of individuals aged 55 to
64 years, 65% of those aged 65-69 years, 63% of those aged 70-74 years, 60% of
those aged 75-79 years and only 57% of those aged 80 years claim to be in
excellent or good health.

3.3.6.   Consumption of health services

    In 1993, the National Advisory Council on Aging (NACA) reported that
22% of the increase in health costs, estimated at 78% in industrialized
countries, was due to demographic factors, including an aging population.

3.3.7.   Older adults and independence

    While independence can refer to many different things when describing
different people -- for example, financial, social or psychological
independence -- the appearance with age of one or more physical disabilities,
combined with various irreversible effects of aging itself and perhaps
aggravated by a handicap, may seriously impair an older person's
independence.  As many older adults can testify, however, the development of
gerontology and geriatrics has removed any direct relationship between aging
and disability, illness and dependence.

    The probability of disability and handicap does, however, increase
with age.  In 1991, 4.2 million Canadian (15.5% of the population) claimed to
be disabled in some way:  7% of children aged less than 15 years, 8% of people
aged 15-34 years, 14% of people aged 35-54 years, 27.1% of people aged
55-64 years and 45% of people aged 65 years and over (including 37% of people
aged 65-74 years, 54% of people aged 75-84 years and 82% of people aged
85 years and over).

    Among the most frequently mentioned disabilities are mobility and
agility problems such as arthritis and rheumatism (55% of respondents),
hearing deficiencies (43%), eyesight deficiencies (24%), hypertension (39%)
and respiratory problems (24%).  Interestingly, the rate of dementia among
older people is 6%.

    According to 1991 data, 20% of older adults require assistance to carry
out some of their daily activities.

3.3.8.   Satisfaction with life

    More than 90% of individuals 45 years and over are satisfied with their
lives, confirming that the quality of life in Canada is very good.

3.3.9.   Marital status

    Not surprisingly, since women have a longer life expectancy than men,
there are more widows than widowers.

    Among Canadians between 65 and 69 years of age, 82% of men but only 53%
of women are married.  After 80 years of age, 70% of men are still married,
compared to 18% of women.

3.3.10.  Living arrangements

    In 1991, according to NACA, 73% of older men and 43% of older women lived
in private households with a spouse, while 14% of older men and 34% of older
women (of which 40% were over 75 years) lived alone.

    In a proportion of 91%, older adults claim no problems with housing. 
Statistics Canada has reported that 80% of households headed by an older
adults owned their own home, while 29% of adults 65 years and over rented their
home.

    The figures are not the same for women, however:  the proportion of
women renters increases with age (28% for women 65-69 years old and 48% for
women aged 80 years and over).

    Finally, between 41% and 46% of social housing units are occupied by
older adults.

3.3.11.  Educational level and school attendance of older adults

    In 1986, about 27% of Canadians aged 65 years and over had graduated
from high school or a post-secondary institution.  Furthermore, this
percentage will almost certainly increase in the coming decades.  The
increase is already under way:  between 1984 and 1991, registrations in adult
education programs and educational activities organized by Elderhostel grew
from 3,000 to 15,000; similarly, those in Creative Retirement Manitoba
programs grew from 200 to 3,000.  NACA estimates that the percentage of
registration in adult education programs will increase 94% by 2005 and 141%
by 2010.

3.3.12.  Literacy among older adults

    As there is a direct, positive relationship between literacy and
educational level, it is not surprising to find that illiteracy is more
prevalent among older Canadians than among young adults.  For example, while
close to three Canadians in four between 16 and 34 years of age have sufficient
skills to meet the requirements of everyday life, this proportion drops to one
in three for people 55 to 69 years of age.

    Furthermore, there is a correlation between the age at which a language
is learned and the acquisition of reading ability in that language.  Literacy
is therefore a particularly serious problem for older immigrants.

    About 2 million people, or 64% of Canadians between 55 and 69 years of
age, have difficulty using written material.  If this situation is not
attended to immediately, it will cause serious problems in coming years as
this cohort gets older.  The higher literacy among succeeding generations,
however, should alleviate the problem.  In response to a national conference
organized in 1990 by One Voice - The Canadian Seniors Network, a Canadian
coalition for literacy among older Canadians will be established to encourage
literacy among this age group.

3.3.13.  How do older adults spend their time?

    Despite the previous figures, however, this group's most popular
activity is reading newspapers, magazines and books:  67% of people aged
45-64 years, 65% of those aged 65-69 years, 64% of those aged 70-74 years, 63%
of those aged 75-79 years and 57% of those aged 80 years or more participate in
this activity.

    Of seniors aged 65-74 years, 66% go out to a restaurant or the theatre
once per month, as do 50% of seniors aged 75 and over.  More than half of older
adults have purchased recreational equipment (sporting goods, video cameras
or VCRs) and use related services.

    On average, 51% of adults aged 45-64 years, 50% of those aged
65-80 years and 35% of those 80 years and older take regular walks.

    Television is a recreational activity for 42% of adults aged
45-64 years and 51% of those aged 65 years and older.  Women watch 4.1 hours per
day, compared with 3.7 hours for men.

    Social activities, such as visiting or receiving friends or relatives,
have an important place in the life of 48% of adults aged 45-64 years and 47%
of those 65 years and over.

    On average, 39% of people 65 years and over attend church, visit
community or shopping centres or are members of an association.

3.3.14.  Retirement

    In 1991, the average retirement age was 62 years.  Among the main
factors influencing an individual's decision to retire are health status,
age, job characteristics, income, spouse's retirement and pressure on the
job.

    In 1991, there were 1.7 million men and 2 million women aged 55 years or
more in the labour force.

3.3.15.  What about seniors' incomes?

    While older adults' economic situation has improved in recent decades,
many older Canadians -- 4% of elderly couples -- still had incomes below the
low-income cutoff in 1990 (in 1980, this percentage was 13%).  Among older men
living alone, this proportion fell from 53% to 26%; among older women living
alone, it fell from 60% to 38%.

    In 1986, 18% of men aged 65-69 years had incomes below $10,000, compared
to 48% of women (60% of these older adults were disabled in some way).

    In 1990, 39% of women and 33% of men aged 65 years and over received
Guaranteed Income Supplements, while 70% of women aged 90 years and over
received these benefits.

    Interestingly, however, statistics show that older adults pay more
than 20 billion dollars in taxes; that they consume goods and services
heavily; that 70% of adults 65 years old and over believe that their income
and investments are sufficient for their future needs; and that 67% of future
retirees consider that they will have enough income when they retire.  A
distinction should be made, however, between poverty statistics (which are
based exclusively on income and do not consider assets) and people's
perceptions of themselves as poor.

    According to 1986 statistics, seniors' main sources of personal income
were the following:
    Canada and Quebec pension plans, which provided 14% of seniors' total
    incomes (16% for men and 11% for women);
    employers' pension, which provided 16% of their income (20% for men and
    11% for women);
    in 1989, 50% of men and 39% of women were covered by private retirement
    plans, although the figures vary among occupational groups:  75% of
    unionized workers, 73% of public sector workers, 53% of full-time
    employees, 39% of private sector workers, 30% of non-unionized workers
    and 24% of part-time employees.

    With respect to seniors' assets, note that 91% of home-owners aged
65 years and over have completely paid off their mortgages (68% of those aged
55-59 years and 84% of those aged 65-70 years).  The overall breakdown of
seniors' assets is as follows:



            Distribution of assets among older adults




        Retirement plans
        Registered retirement plans
        Other investments
        Principal residence
        Mortgage-free residence
          Other real estate investments


     57%
     67%
     37%
     80%
     66%
     25%




To summarize:
    older adults pay 20 billion dollars in taxes;
    in 1991, 20% of adults aged 65 years or older were living on an income
    below the low-income cutoff;
    of those living alone, average incomes were lowest for young people
    (15 to 24 years of age) and those 65 years and older:  $14,935 and
    $18,056, respectively;
    women 65 years and older living alone formed the group in which low
    incomes were most prevalent;
    in 1991, median family income for seniors and non-family persons was
    $48,300; average income was $40,036.

3.3.16.  Social action among people 55 years and older

    Not only do seniors contribute to the national economy by paying taxes
and consuming goods and services, they also contribute socially by doing
volunteer work (more than 30% of people 65 years and older), providing various
types of social support, helping their own children and grandchildren
organize their lives, giving to charities, and so on.

3.3.17.  Predictions for the 21st century

    According to Statistics Canada's projections of population
demographics by age group, the population of Canada will be 29,297,100 on
June 1, 2010; close to 30% of these people will be more than 55 years old.

    Statistics Canada forecasts that, toward 2020, about 6 million
Canadians will be 65 years old or more, and that in 2036 this number will be
about 8 million.  The numerical imbalance between the sexes for older adults
is expected to continue.







3.4.     Conclusion

    To summarize, people 55 years old and over are a very heterogeneous
group.  Their interests, activities, living situation, needs, financial
situation, health status, and family and social environments must be
considered in products designed to serve them.  Moreover, senior adults
participate in a wide variety of activities individually, in their families,
among friends or in groups.

    This group accounted for 20.4% of Canadians in 1991; by 2010, it is
expected to include 29.5% of the population.  The profile of senior Canadians
at that time, however, will not be the same as it is today.  For example,
seniors will enjoy longer life expectancies and better overall health. 
Individuals born in 1960 can expect to live at least 20 years longer than those
born at the beginning of the century.  These new generations of older adults
will also be increasingly well-educated.

    While workers in 1991 were retiring at 62 years of age on average, there
are four reasons that suggest that the trend toward earlier retirement will
not necessarily continue:
    the type of work and the organization of the workplace depend less and
    less on physical strength or endurance;
    older workers (45-64 years) will remain in good physical and
    intellectual condition (much more so than those of similar age who
    preceded them);
    a shortage of adequately trained, experienced and competent workers
    to meet society's needs is forecast for the not-too-distant future;
    insufficient income will compel some people to return to the labour
    force.

    The increase in the number of older adults, especially those over
80 years of age, will create additional demand for research and development
to create new products to help a group in which most people have one or more
disabilities.

    In a society aging at a phenomenal rate, there is ample justification
for conducting research and development to create technology better adapted,
on the one hand, to seniors' interests and the physiological, psychological
and social changes they experience and, on the other hand, to society's
changing information and communication needs for the 21st century.



4.  RESEARCH RESULTS



4.1.     Review of the Literature

4.1.1.   Goals and objectives

    A review of the literature and in-depth study of documents concerned
with technology and relevant in some way to independent older adults was
deemed essential to establish a reasonably accurate portrait of the status,
as of 1993, of such technologies in Canada and abroad.

    This part of the research was guided by two sets of general objectives:

A)  Improve understanding of gerontechnology.

    Research of this type was conducted:
    to clearly identify the kinds of relationships that may exist between
    older adults and CITs;
    to gain a firm understanding of the way in which technologies may
    become a part of this clientele's everyday activities;
    to reveal the technology-related attitudes, needs and behaviour of
    various categories of Canadians aged 55 years and over and attempt to
    answer the following questions:  Who are these older users?  Why and how
    will they use some of these technologies?  What are the incentives and
    hurdles to using them?
    to identify CIT-related research and development needs in the area of
    gerontology.

B)  Establish relationships with industry.




4.1.2.   Methodology

    A systematic data base search was relatively straightforward, through
the co-operation of a number of reference resources such as the Information
Service for Integrated Resources (ISIR) at CITI's Documentation Centre; the
Cote des Neiges Hospital library; universities specializing in gerontology;
gerontology associations in Quebec and the rest of Canada; the One Voice
network; and government and municipal libraries.

    In addition, 250 agencies, associations, government departments,
universities and other organizations working with older adults at the
international, national and provincial level were invited to submit
references.

    In all, 107 articles were eventually selected from the assembled
literature.  Most of these were produced in the United States and Canada,
while some came from Europe.  All were published between 1988 and 1993.

4.1.3.   Compilation of results

Clientele under study

    Almost all studies place major emphasis on the effects of aging on
various variables:  for example, the impact of a number of technological
components or a comparison of seniors' performance with that of other age
groups.  Since the conclusions do not apply to the same age groups, however,
it is very difficult to compare findings.



    Although several authors speak out against the tendency to consider
older adults as a homogeneous group, very few studies are sensitive to the
subtle differences that distinguish one cohort from another.  For while
individual characteristics must not be overlooked, each cohort is typified
by particular values, historical and psycho-social experiences, mechanisms
for adaptation to the environment, and other traits.

    These cohorts are better understood by grouping them in various ways
according to activities, interests, or life setting.  Suggested groupings are
based primarily on:
    degree of independence (independent, non-independent, bedridden,
    etc.);
    handicap (physical, social, mental);
    type of residence (house, apartment, low-rental housing, retirement
    community, rest home);
    recreational pursuits (physical, intellectual, social activities,
    etc.);
    meeting places (community, medical, social, religious, etc.);
    former workplace;
    mother tongue.

Studies concerned with handicaps and sensory disabilities

    Too often, researchers view older adults and handicapped persons as one
and the same clientele.  Clearly, a handicapped person who has grown older
does not have to cope with the same problems as an older person who becomes
handicapped late in life and who, because of the risk of multi-pathological
complications due to age itself, has even more obstacles to overcome than a
younger person does.

    Although the risk of developing disabilities and handicaps increases
significantly with age, studies of physically, mentally or
psycho-geriatrically handicapped individuals and technologies designed to
serve them have been purposely overlooked in favour of studies of sensory
disabilities.  In particular, given the critical importance of the senses in
the use of CITs and the increased incidence of sensory impairment with age,
this review covers about thirty articles concerned with technologies and
sensory (visual, aural and tactile) disabilities or handicaps.

    Future research should therefore explore the relationship between CITs
and older adults handicapped in one or more ways.

Older adults and technologies reviewed in the research

    What follows is an inventory of technological applications recognized
as useful for older adults with or without sensory impairment or handicap.

    The computer is central to more than half the research devoted to this
area.  The computer and its applications appear capable of meeting diverse
needs, whether for personal purposes (such as electronic mail, spreadsheets
or word processing), for access to information services or for teleworking.

    Telephony and telematics (advanced telephone services, video
telephone, teleshopping, bank transactions, aural and visual electronic
information in public places, etc.) were the topic of 22 studies.

    Home automation (to which 21 articles are devoted) is also generating
considerable interest because it presents simple technical solutions capable
of satisfying multiple, complex requirements arising from home care of
individuals with health problems, disabilities or handicaps.

    About 12 studies were concerned with alarm systems capable of
neutralizing feelings of insecurity and vulnerability (especially among
women living alone and handicapped individuals), and therefore likely to
encourage older people to continue living at home.

    The ten articles concerned with technologies (such as video cameras and
VCRs) used for entertainment or heritage conservation purposes have been
grouped under the same heading.

    Furthermore, five studies were concerned with the use of automated
teller machines and cash dispensers.

    Completely unexpected findings appeared throughout these studies; a
good example concerns older adults' interest in video games and their ability
to use them.

    Finally, a few studies were concerned with assistance technologies
such as hearing aids, telephones for hearing impaired, Braille readers and
voice recognition techniques; two documents discussed bar code readers; and
three discussed interactive television.

4.2.     Older adults' attitudes, needs, interests and behaviour

    Most attention focussed on studies of older adults' attitudes, needs,
interests and behaviour with respect to technology.  This section first
groups studies according to the type of technology; they are then reviewed
with respect to the role of the technologies in meeting seniors' existing and
potential needs; the ability of a particular technology to penetrate this
market; obstacles to its use and factors that facilitate learning; seniors'
attitudes; and methods for promoting the technology.



4.2.1.   Older adults and technology in general

Effects of aging

    In reporting on a major 1991 study concerned with older adults'
attitudes toward technology (the TUDOR study), Collins and Bhatti remarked
that the factor determining usage of a telecommunications technology is not
the user's age but the level of his or her interest and that, consequently,
equipment design is important.

    Physiological changes due to aging can cause problems for someone
learning new technologies and using them.  Girardin (1991) prepared a list of
the principal changes (most of which, however, may be overcome through
training) that can affect faculties essential for using CITs.  In addition,
Madden (1992) reported a positive correlation between an individual's age and
his or her average reaction time, which increases with the complexity of the
task and is longest for individuals with eyesight problems.

    Brooks and Gordon (1988) point out that CIT designers should take
account of the following:  12.8% of adults over age 65 suffer from significant
eyesight deficits, which show up as a loss of visual acuity and increased
difficulty in adapting to darkness and perceiving colours and contrasts.

    There is also an age-related decrease in tactile acuity in the
fingertips, which reduces the potential for touch-sensitive screens or
tactile reading of texts transcribed for this purpose (Stevens, 1992).

    According to Czaja and Barr (1989), new technologies must be reconciled
with the phenomenon of an aging population; in particular, the various stages
of life and the characteristics of older adults (specifically the abilities
and limitations that affect them in their everyday lives) must be kept in
mind.  They recommend that special attention be given to the workplace
environment, home workstations, possible uses of telecommunications for
socializing and the educational potential of television.  Care must also be
taken to ensure that networks are used optimally and that relevant
information is available.

    Alpiner and Vaughn (1988) report a loss of hearing acuity after 65 years
(one of the five most common chronic afflictions in the United States), which
may have important emotional consequences in the lives of older adults.  Since
current hearing aid technologies cannot always compensate for problems
arising in public listening situations, and since older adults do not want to
carry equipment that makes them look old, this problem tends to be overlooked.

    Bouchard-Ryan (1985) reports that, age-related memory loss problems
notwithstanding, functional memory is a better indicator of video game
learning than short-term memory.  The author concludes that regular use of the
game and relevant feedback (given on the screen at the end of the game)
improves participants' reaction speed, regardless of age.

Profile of older technology consumers

    A particular profile typifies older adults who understand the
usefulness of new technologies.  Festervand and Wylde (1988), Harris (1988),
Blaich (1991) and Chappell (unpublished, 1993) describe older consumers
favourable to technology as educated; urban; considerably younger than
average; more active; financially well off; and possessing some prior
experience with current technologies in one form or another.  On the other
hand, sex, health status and the quality of social relationships do not seem
to directly influence people's opinions.  Older adults having several of
these characteristics are viewed as leaders within their cohort and act as the
best means of promoting the technology.

    Gilly and Zeithaml (1985) write that today's older adults have already
adjusted to many technological changes and can certainly do it again if made
aware of the technology in the appropriate way.  They suggest dealing directly
with older adults, who demand adequate information before adopting an
innovation.  When computers were marketed to consumers, for example, they
were completely ignored.

    Older adults show strong emotional reactions when asked to use a
technology involving inappropriately designed equipment and unsatisfactory
information on the existence, usefulness or advantages of possible
applications (Brooks and Gordon, 1988).

    Jay and Willis (1992) confirm that older persons' attitudes can be
modified by experience, which itself depends on training, product
user-friendliness and products' ability to meet several needs.

    Several researchers, including Robert Kane, have advocated that
particular attention be directed to the possible impacts of technological
innovations on people's lives.  An assessment of the appropriateness of a
particular technology for older adults should not be based solely on
immediate circumstances but should take account of consequences for society.

Role of technologies

    Research has shown that, contrary to popular belief, older adults
generally have a rather positive attitude toward technology.  As
Bjorneby (1991) and most other authors point out, however, seniors' attitudes
are always favourable to the extent that they perceive some payoff such as the
potential for meeting one or more of their needs or improving their health,
quality of life or safety.  They recognize that they rely on technology to
preserve their independence.  Technologies are viewed as useful to the extent
that they alleviate seniors' concerns.  Older consumers will modify their
behaviour if two conditions are met:  first, the technology must be useful to
them; second, someone must make them aware of its advantages, demystify it and
adequately train them (Harris, 1988).  Older adults will be interested in any
equipment, appliance or service likely to improve their quality of life, or
in any innovation capable of linking them to information systems and
providing them with services at home (Gilly and Zeithaml, 1985).

    According to Stunkel (1991), CITs can be used for distance education,
teleshopping and remote medical consultation.  They also increase the
efficiency of existing distribution networks.

    Older adults appear to take easily to the following applications: 
remote medical consultations; home workstations; custom telephone calling
services; and systems for electronic reading, direct payment in supermarkets
and electronic funds transfer (Gilly and Zeithaml, 1985).

    Blaich (1992) recommends that product designers consider the
entertainment value of the system to the user; his or her ability to dominate
the system; installation cost and complexity; and the possibility of adding
functions through modular design.

    Elmer-Dewit (1993) describes the unprecedented potential of
electronic highways for meeting the daily needs of seniors.  A number of
interactive services for teleshopping, consulting databases at libraries or
other institutions, and communicating with financial institutions are
already available.

    New technologies will become increasingly important in our aging
society, especially with the development of advanced medical technologies.



Hindrances to the use of CITs by seniors

    The most frequently cited hindrances are cost, a lack of awareness and
training and problems with user-friendliness.  La Buda (1988) also notes that
older adults are very concerned that certain equipment may make them look
older or marginalize them.

    Stewart (1991) reviews problems experienced by older adults in coping
with images, sound, the keyboard and the interface, by relating these to the
effects of aging.  He then recommends an ergonomic approach to the entire
design process that would consider such characteristics of the older user as
size, weight, strength, endurance and limitations.  Watzke (1992) takes a
similar approach to home automation by recommending elimination of obstacles
(such as lighting, stairways or floor coverings) that can cause falls.

    While older adults take a fairly positive attitude toward technology,
they do not act readily on these attitudes.  For example, Gilly and
Zeithaml (1985) conclude that a very small percentage of older adults intend
to experiment with technologies such as the computer and that very few adults
aged 65 years and older (less than 1% in the United States) actually use these
technologies.

    Bouchard-Ryan (1986) cautions those who promote CITs to older adults
that they should recognize that the later stages of life create significant
needs, that certain factors may limit the usefulness of computers and that an
individual's vitality and sociability can be negatively affected by computer
overuse.

    Another problem has been brought to the attention of specialists in
gerontechnology.  Trencher (1988) complains of the lack of co-ordination and
communication between designers, sellers, users and professionals in
promoting new products, programs or technology-based services capable of
improving the quality of life for older adults and compensating for a number
of age-related disabilities.

    Older adults' technology-related attitudes and needs and technical
capabilities vary greatly among nations and among continents, making any
comparison difficult.  Van Noorden and McEwan (1991) describe one of the
European RACE program projects that attempts to demonstrate that
telecommunications services (implementation of video telephones) may help
individuals with motor, speech or eyesight disabilities.  The authors note,
for example, that older German adults do not want the technology to look like
office equipment, and that Portuguese seniors reject anything having to do
with telecommunication as too complicated.  They conclude, nonetheless, that
video telephone technology is easy for older adults to use and, by
compensating for certain disabilities, may facilitate social relationships
and improve the quality of their lives.

Marketing, technology and seniors

    Furlong (1989) complains that the computer revolution neglected
35 million adults aged 55 years and older, that is, 20% of the total
population.  Similarly, Blaich (1991) indicates that American consumers
aged 50 and over account for 47% of the potential market and 77% of household
spending power and that older and younger clients' profiles are similar in a
number of respects.

    Importantly, pre-retirees or retirees have more time for recreational
activities and spend more time at home.  La Buda (1988) points out that the
needs and characteristics of older users must be understood and that
companies must market products more actively to this clientele.  Older adults
represent a new, vast, diverse population that is fertile ground for
telecommunications technologies (Stunkel, 1991).

    The technology should adapt to the consumer, not the contrary. 
Monk (1988) comments that while technology can harm older persons if used
inappropriately, it can play an important role in seniors' everyday lives (by
breaking their isolation) if used correctly.

    Bowe (1988) warns that manufacturers should design their products so
as not to marginalize senior adults, who want to feel as if they belong in the
community.  Otherwise, as happened with Videotext in Florida, manufacturers
may not get through to their target population.  Note, too, that technology is
developing more rapidly than psychology.

Learning of CITs by older adults
"You are never too old to learn."
Rudick Roger (1988)

    Gilly and Zeithaml (1985), in reviewing the process of adoption of new
technologies, conclude that it follows the following model:
    knowledge;
    persuasion;
    decision;
    implementation.

    Bouwhuis (1991) has demonstrated the need for thoroughly understanding
the learning process and for working within the bounds of users' perceptual
capabilities.

    Research by Bouchard-Ryan (1992) demonstrated that aging can have a
significant impact on performance of a computer learning task.

    In Rott's (1988) opinion, older adults' judgments regarding CITs are
shaped by their motivation for using the technologies and on perceived
positive aspects or potential dangers, which in turn are influenced by an
interaction between educational level and previous experience.  Rott claims
that programs to instruct seniors in the use of CITs will not be maximally
effective and helpful unless their cost is reduced and they are made more
accessible.

    By using current distribution networks more efficiently, CITs can play
a role in satisfying increasing demand for adult education and distance
education.  For this to work, however, older adults must possess (and know how
to use) basic equipment such as computers and modems.  Among the advantages of
CITs for such an application are their ability to work with instructional
material in different formats (Young, 1989; Stunkel, 1991).

    Straka (1986) published a revealing study, based on results of a 1981
survey of Americans aged 45 years and over, of older adults' behaviour with
respect to new technologies.  As this survey is already over ten years old, the
percentages may be slightly different today; they still, however, reflect the
dissonance between discourse and behaviour.  Here is a summary of the results
of this survey:
    37% of subjects subscribed to cable television service;
    8% used a video cassette recorder;
    50% used a calculator;
    50% claimed that technology had not really made their daily life
    easier;
    50% said that machines did so much of the work that there was not much
    left to do;
    87% said that they make life very impersonal;
    87% said that people could do things faster and better using
    technologies;

    34% claimed that life would be easier and better when people could do
    everything from home using telephone and cable;
    women watch more television than men, regardless of age; watching
    increases at about age 55, reaches its peak at 70 years, and decreases
    afterwards.

    Eilers (1989) draws relationships between educational level, the use
of electronic tools such as the VCR or calculator and older adults' attitudes
and behaviour.  She claims that older adults would be more interested in
learning to use a computer if they were provided with adequate instructions,
preferably by their peers.

What do older adults look for in a technology?

    Most of the researches show that older adults who adopt CITs want to
improve the quality of their lives.  They have the following objectives:
    learn;
    satisfy general curiosity, keep up with the times;
    remain mentally active;
    encourage social contact between generations;
    develop new friendships based on common interests;
    improve their self-esteem;
    improve memory and skills;
    increase feelings of accomplishment;
    control the environment;
    make some extra money.





4.2.2.   Principal conclusions related to particular technologies

Telephone

    Bowe (1990) indicates that 70% of Americans aged 51 and over, as well
as of those with sensory, physical or learning disabilities, are interested
in using CITs as long as they don't have to purchase a computer, modem or any
other equipment (although 16% of those 51 years old and over already have a
personal computer and modem).  Seniors are, however, prepared to pay up to $14
extra per month for new telephone services, of which three were seen as
priorities:
    electronic directories;
    home safety (fire and burglar alarms, etc.);
    medical advice.

    Like most researchers, Infante-Rivard (1988) points out that the
telephone is the technological tool that older adults find easiest to use and
integrate most easily into such daily activities as socializing, conducting
bank transactions and obtaining medical care.  Furthermore, it is essential
in emergencies.  The author notes that older adults find it easy to discuss
their health over the telephone, accept advice regarding healthy life habits,
and seek out recommendations on how to care for minor problems.  Telephone
contact between older adults and health professionals may reduce the demand
for medical services and cause the frequency of medical consultations to
decline.  They also provide emotional comfort and serve to reassure family
members.

    The key role of telephone systems in older adults' homes is
underestimated; moreover, available services are poorly adapted to the needs
of this clientele.  For example, while 99% of Swedish seniors believe that the
telephone is essential to their life and more than 50% of them have two or
three telephones, 32% would like their telephone to be linked to an emergency
response system, 15% would like a telephone with memory and 34% wished that
the directory were easier to use (they find the printing too small and the
presentation incoherent).  Several respondents suggested that telephone
booths should be better insulated from background noise (Collins et al, 1991;
Östlund, 1993).

    Moreover, Van Noorden and McEwan (1991) conclude that advanced
telecommunications services such as video telephones may be useful to older
adults with one or more disabilities.  When uncomplicated and easy to use,
video telephones could establish contact between the home and an assistance
centre, encourage social interaction, make it possible for responders to
quickly obtain more complete information on a patient's status, provide an
impression that someone is present and facilitate comprehension for those
with hearing problems.  Telephones can foster autonomy in older adults whose
mobility has been reduced and, at the same time, make professional services
designed for them less cumbersome.  In addition, audiovisual material
encourages high-quality interaction without generating a fear of technology
(Robinson, 1991).

    Access to telephone systems designed for active and passive
monitoring, listening and emergency response must be encouraged. 
Trickey (1993) claims that these systems will be more easily accepted if their
advantages and operating instructions are more adequately presented and if
the differences between the various types of systems are explained.

Video cassette recorder

    While recognizing the recreational, informational and educational
value of video cassette recorders (VCRs), Fletcher (1986) reviewed their
appropriateness for certain projects.  By recording reminiscences on audio
or video tape, seniors foster a sense of continuity within the family, gain an
opportunity to preserve their knowledge, wisdom and experience and help to
strengthen family identity.  Seniors who feel a profound need to tell their
story could use this process, as could younger people who want to know about
the past or find their place in their family tree.

    Yahnke (1989) strongly suggests using VCRs for educational films that
involve older adults while meeting certain standards.  In addition, he
recommends that such equipment be used to create documentaries, portraits of
real or fictional persons and concrete illustrations of the aging process.

Computer

    The United States contains a pool of 35 million older potential
computer users (Rudick, 1992).  These individuals, who already consume
heavily, will constitute a growing market.  The percentage of seniors using
the computer will increase phenomenally in the near future, as those
currently on the job market retire.  Among other services, older adults would
like access to health information, teleshopping and home banking
(Recio, 1990).

Attitudes toward the computer

    Older adults express fear and reluctance toward new technologies such
as the computer (Bouchard-Ryan, 1989).  Seniors view the technology as
worthwhile only if accompanied by satisfactory information concerning
potential advantages and applications specifically relevant to them.

    In addition, there are a number of negative attitudes toward (and
prejudices against) older adults with respect to their ability or skill in
using computers.  Most frequently heard are these:
    the older people get, the less capable they are of using computers;
    seniors who do manage to do this are not representative of their age
    group.

    Contact between health professionals and older adults using the
telephone and computer may be appropriate for seniors (especially those in
remote areas), particularly since older adults tend to complain about their
relationships with their doctor (Greenberger and Puffer, 1989).

    Bouchard-Ryan (1990), in a portrait of the interaction between older
adults and computers, points out that, while older adults have adapted to many
technological changes since the beginning of the 20th century, they have more
difficulty with the computer -- even if it is widely used throughout society
and could improve the quality of daily life considerably.  FThe author
provides some statistics on seniors' attitudes toward computers:  40% of
those aged 45-64 years, 34% of those aged 55-64 years and 20% of those 65 years
and older view this technology favourably.  She explains the attitude of the
older respondents as follows:  they don't need it; they can't use it; and they
are concerned by their relationship with the machine since the human
dimension of various aspects of life increases in importance with age.

    Previous experience with technology and a positive attitude toward the
phenomenon are two of the most important factors favouring adoption of the
computer.  Interestingly, attitudes are shaped by income.  In keeping with
other findings in the area, Hahm and Bickson (1989) precisely identified the
factors influencing adoption and use of computers (specifically electronic
mail and working in networks) by retirees:  some knowledge of the technology,
sufficient financial resources and a fairly strong educational background.

    Older adults are looking for different things depending on their age
bracket:
    people aged 40-64 years want efficiency and safety;
    people aged 65-74 years want comfort and safety;
    people over 75 like programs, services and equipment that can help them
    in their everyday lives (Bouchard-Ryan, 1990).

Obstacles to the use of computers by older adults

    Stewart (1991) explains that older adults may experience a number of
problems when using computers, for the following reasons:
    they have more to unlearn from their accumulated experience;
    their faculties are diminished;
    they harbour certain fears, probably caused by their own or others'
    previous unfortunate experiences;
    they are afraid of making mistakes;
    they have preferences, needs and requirements that the marketplace
    ignores;
    they have doubts about the proclaimed wonders and benefits of this
    technology.

    Stewart notes, however, that the real problem can be found in
unsatisfactory computer design, which does not consider the user's size,
strength and limitations.  The computer should be easy to understand and use,
safe, attractive, practical, made of appropriate materials and durable; in
addition, its performance should justify its cost.

    There is a relationship between people's facility in using the
equipment and their motivation to do so.  Older adults have positive attitudes
toward technological changes and computers if they find these innovations
useful in some way (Recio, 1990).  As seniors form a heterogeneous group,
however, close attention should be paid to their various attitudes,
perceptions and modes of learning.

    The higher the income of older adults, the more education they have and
the more interest they take in technological products -- if they see any use
in them.  Design, cost and system compatibility problems must be solved. 
Potential older users will accept any simple, attractive technology designed
specifically for this group and marketed adequately (La Buda, 1988).

    Care should be taken to avoid situations that may provoke negative
reactions in older adults and cause them to become discouraged.  Older adults,
particularly those undergoing rehabilitation for physical disabilities, are
prone to anxiety (Ujimoto, 1992).

    Seniors react emotionally to equipment intended for them but poorly
designed.  Charness (1990) comments that, since design rules and standards
generally do not consider population aging, the usefulness of such equipment
for older adults is limited.

    The risks of overuse and isolation can have an impact on various facets
of life.  If technologies such as the computer reduce social contact, they run
counter to stated objectives (Östlund, 1992).  In addition, a number of older
adults may engage in behaviour best described as passive.  The technical
benefits should be consistent with the user's objectives.  For example,
retired people have an ample supply of free time; therefore, they may not care
if computers save time or not.

Teaching older adults to use computers

    Learning a computer-related task depends on training, not attitudes. 
The effects of age on this process must be assessed using paradigms derived
from perception and attitude research.  Even if young people are often better
at performing tasks requiring particular skills and show higher success rates
when learning tasks, the learning abilities of people aged 55 and over must
not be underestimated (Bouchard-Ryan, 1991; Czaja et al, 1989;
Furlong, 1990).

    While attitudes toward the computer tend to become more negative with
age, older adults who undergo training designed specifically for them obtain
results similar to younger people (Zandri, 1989).


    Such training should be designed with the following ideas in mind:
    it is much more economical to conduct training in two-person teams;
    older adults take twice as long to learn as younger people;
    they should be able to learn at their own rate, with an instructor
    available to answer their questions;
    their attitudes are intimately linked to their performance.

    While older adults have ambiguous attitudes toward technology in
general and computers in particular, they are willing to adapt to these
technologies and learn the skills necessary for doing so.  These attitudes can
be modified through direct experience and depend on training, comfort and
computer efficiency (Jay and Willis, 1992).

    McNeely (1991) confirms that while age, level of education and previous
keyboard experience are important factors, do not determine learning
achievement.

    Eilers (1989), in reviewing the receptivity to training of older
workers, concluded that they managed to learn despite initial negative
attitudes.  Older workers can use computers to make a smooth transition
between the labour force and retirement.  Eilers gives the following examples
of factors creating resistance to participation in a computer training
course:  course taught by a younger instructor; competition with younger
students; program too mathematical or career-oriented; and problems caused
by one or more physical disabilities.

Older adults' computer needs

    There is an immediate, crying need for computer skills among older
adults.  Since the client profile changes regularly, the clientele is
becoming more diversified and needs are changing, the system should be
flexible (Merrill, 1992).

    Furlong, from the SeniorNet network in the United States, has remarked
that older adults want intellectual stimulation and have a great deal of
patience and perseverence.

    Computers and telecommunications are more than a means by which seniors
can gain access to information:  they can meet, work on individual or joint
projects, communicate among themselves, and get emotional support as well. 
They view these technologies as a means of participating in contemporary
culture and staying in touch with the world.

    Older Swedish adults have accepted the computer well.  While some
adaptation (particularly with respect to visual accessibility) remains to be
made, computer technology has had positive effects (Östlund, 1992).  A number
of factors encourage seniors to participate in computer-related activities. 
Therapists and others who work with older adults should receive training to
assist seniors losing their autonomy in using this equipment.

    Therefore, the abilities of new generations of older adults with
respect to new technologies, (including the computer) should not be
overlooked.  It is no longer acceptable to extrapolate to tomorrow's older
adults from experiments conducted with seniors of yesteryear
(Kautzmann, 1990).  Students in occupational therapy and others who work with
older adults should be made aware of the recreational possibilities of the
computer.  Such activities can improve seniors' self-esteem and
self-mastery; in addition, this approach can improve interaction with this
clientele.  One can expect that the attitudes and behaviour of the baby-boom
generation with respect to technology, especially computers, will have a
major impact on the use of technological devices (Chin, 1985).




Television

    After the telephone, television is the technology most thoroughly
integrated into the lives of retirees (Greenberger and Puffer, 1989; Caron
et al, 1992).  Erkert notes that American adults aged 70 and over watch twice
as much television as the national average.  This quite probably reflects the
phenomenon of substitution, in which relationships established with program
hosts or actors compensate for a lack of genuine emotional ties.

    Straka (1986) notes that women watch more television than men,
regardless of age.  Television watching begins to increase at about age 55,
reaches its peak at age 70 and declines afterwards.  While television is
usually a source of entertainment, 34% of those interviewed by this
researcher claimed that life would be easier and better when transactions
take place from home, using telephone and cable.  Older adults are also
largely responsible for the increased use of media for educational purposes.

    Various forms of captioning enable older hearing-impaired adults to
participate more easily in simple activities of everyday social life such as
attending meetings or workshops; care must be taken, however, that characters
do not leave the screen too fast or that the size of characters is appropriate
to clients' abilities (Howe and Graham, 1990).

Sensory assistance equipment

    As mentioned above, this review only covers research concerned with
sensory disabilities or handicaps.  Most of these studies look at
technologies that compensate for auditory or visual handicaps.

    As a rule, older adults are reluctant to use assistive devices that may
marginalize them or make them look older (Alpiner and Vaughn, 1988;
Bowe, 1988).

    Attitudes toward hearing aids are somewhat more negative than those
toward eyeglasses, which are more common because people of all ages wear them. 
Alpiner (1988) points out that attitudes toward hearing aids range from full
acceptance to uncertainty and rejection.

    Senior adults who gradually lose their hearing have very specific
problems, which are largely misunderstood.  Pehringer (1989) notes that the
network of alternative resources is not sufficiently well developed and
accessible to make home autonomy possible on a broader scale.  As Parker and
Thorslund (1991) point out, this conclusion applies to many types of
technical assistance intended for older adults.  Their research revealed that
little is known about these products because information is not available;
they suggest that further information be disseminated to the general public,
professionals who work with seniors, the staff of institutions, and the older
adults who need it.

    While recognizing this problem of access to information,
Trencher (1988) identifies other obstacles, such as the interest of
professionals.  Some time must be expected to pass before those with a direct
interest in the equipment (seniors and care professionals) find out about
them and take an interest.  Trencher also notes that these products are not
always commercially viable.

    Whitten (1988) adds that advantage should be taken of seniors' talents
and experience throughout the process of designing and installing these
assistance devices, so that the equipment can in fact help to maintain
seniors' independence and society can give them an opportunity to earn an
income despite their disability.





Home automation

    Several researchers present home automation, or the smart house, as an
advanced option for providing home care and for compensating for age-related
disabilities.

    The changes that occur at retirement (as well as their causes) must be
thoroughly understood, before technological applications or programs likely
to help older adults remain independent as long as possible can be identified.

    Quite often, the following kinds of changes occur:
    the children leave home;
    income decreases substantially;
    health problems are more common;
    activities become increasingly limited;
    there may be housing problems;
    eventually, one of the spouses may die, or one or both may be
    institutionalized (Struyk, 1988).

    In addition, older adults' needs vary considerably depending on their
status as home-owner or renter, their financial situation, their race, their
residence (urban vs rural) and their problems of daily living related to age
or physical limitations.  Prud'homme (1986) points out that it is difficult
to distinguish housing needs from more general needs for assistance. 
Therefore, housing needs must be specified precisely, if satisfactory home
automation services are to be provided.  In addition, a number of problems are
not specific to older adults but affect the entire population.

    Smart houses will increase older adults' self-esteem if designed to
encourage their autonomy in conducting their everyday activities such as bank
transactions (Östlund, 1992).

    Home automation facilitates working at home and provides access to
entertainment and telecommunications.  In addition, it encourages access to
information, makes the home more energy efficient and enables older adults
and disabled persons to remain at home for longer periods (Chin, 1985;
Girardin, 1991; Östlund, 1992).

    There are, however, a number of problems with home automation in
general and applications intended for older consumers in particular.  In
addition to problems related to installation costs or difficulties, smart
houses have the additional disadvantage of being designed for a specific
stage of life without any thought given to changes and transitions that affect
the individual throughout his or her life.  As older adults want to remain
independent and at home as long as possible, provision must be made for
diminished perception and abilities that make people more vulnerable late in
life.  Whitten (1988) reminds the home automation industry that, to better
meet the needs of older adults, they must actively consult seniors (disabled
or not) in the design and installation process.

    Watzke and Kemp (1992) consider that home automation offers
interesting prevention possibilities.  Accidents are the fifth most common
cause of death in the United States; in addition, falls are the most frequent
accidents among older people, accounting for 70% of fatal accidents for those
aged 65 and over.  Most falls occur because older adults do not adjust their
activities and demands on the environment to their ability level; various
devices in an smart house (such as lighting systems that come on when a person
walks by or devices sensitive to loss of balance and falls) could remedy this
problem.

Automated teller machines

    Very little research has examined the use of automated teller machines
(ATMs).  Moreover, while existing research is not very recent, their findings
corroborate more current results regarding technology in general.

    Gilly and Zeithaml (1985) claim that older adults are a growing segment
of consumers in this market segment.  Since older consumers adopt a favourable
attitude if the technology meets their needs and if they are well informed,
they will probably accept the behavioural change introduced by automated
teller machines.  In addition, they are quite favourable to electronic funds
transfer systems:  44% of those who requested information on this technology
were older.

    In Europe, Rudinger et al (1991) reviewed technological applications
used by older adults, such as public transport ticket dispensers.  One of
their conclusions is that designers of these terminals should eliminate all
possible confusion regarding the type of information dispensed and provide
for a response delay consistent with older adults' reaction times.

Alarm systems

    Most studies of alarm or security systems were conducted in Europe.

    Collins et al (1992) remark that 20% of Dutch seniors have an alarm
system, which gives them a feeling of safety, but that 33% of seniors who
possessed a portable system were not carrying it when they needed it.

    In 1991 and 1992, Östlund conducted several studies on this topic which
reviewed, among other things, older adults' behaviour with respect to
residential alarm systems.  She concluded that retirees tend to select
residences equipped with these devices because they can then plan to live
safely at home for longer periods.  Seniors will not trust these systems
unless they thoroughly understand how they work and are sufficiently skilled
at using them.  Finally, such systems lighten families' burden of
responsibility.

    Care givers, however, may be the only daily contact for people
connected to these emergency response systems.  These devices do nothing to
alleviate dependence, solitude and isolation.  The idea of waiting for
someone to come once the alarm has been sounded may in fact increase anxiety. 
Older adults themselves are not the chief proponents of these systems.


5.  INDUSTRY SURVEY



5.1.     Goals and objectives

    The second component of the study examines relevant issues from the
point of view of private sector firms interested in developing CITs to serve
people with special needs.

5.2.     Methodology

    This component of the study was concerned with roughly ten
technological applications.

    In all, 25 private firms and about 30 government agencies and other
Canadian or foreign organizations with an interest in older adults were
identified.  The heads of marketing, research, public relations and customer
service departments were contacted.

    In telephone interviews, respondents were asked the extent to which
their organization was interested in older adults, what services it offered
them and, if appropriate, why they were not interested in this clientele.

    In addition, results from respondents' own in-house surveys and market
studies were collected, accompanied by comments confirming the importance of
this study and expressing a desire to be informed of the results and,
possibly, take part in research and development to address these issues.

    What follows is a summary of their responses, which clearly indicates
the nature of their concerns with respect to older adults.

5.2.1.   Banking industry

    Very few studies or statistics on the use of various banking services
are available.

    For example, the banking industry was not particularly concerned with
older adults when implementing automatic teller machines.  It was not until
the implementation process was under way or completed that any attention was
paid to serving this clientele.

    One Canadian bank explains this by pointing out that only 13% of its
customers are 55 years of age or older.  Furthermore, it appears that 88% of
its older customers do not want bank cards, preferring to be served at the
counter.  (Note, however, that 10% do have a card and have used it while 2% have
a card but have never used it.)  This behaviour can be explained by:
    fear of machines, especially among oldest customers;
    fear of making a mistake;
    intolerance toward having to wait in line in front of a machine (they
    are more tolerant of the same wait if they know that they will be served
    by a person).

    The caisse populaire and credit union movement, recognized as the
banking institution preferred by retirees, conducted an internal survey of
older adults' use of automatic banking services.  Here is a summary of their
findings:
    40% of retirees (aged 55 and over) personally carry one or more
    automatic teller machine cards; 75% of these people have only one card,
    while 13% have two;
    48% of retirees used their card(s) an average of 6.7 times in the month
    preceding the survey; 95% of the time they withdrew funds, while 34% of
    the time they made a deposit;
    during this month, people aged 65 years and over used their cards
    6.8 times to make a direct payment, compared with 4.2 times for younger
    people.

5.2.2.   Visual Communication Network (Réseau de communication visuelle)

    In 1992, the research firm CROP conducted an opinion survey for the
Montreal Urban Community Transport Corporation to gauge the attitudes and
perceptions of riders with reduced mobility regarding the Visual
Communication Network (Réseau de communication visuelle).

The following riders were surveyed:
    visually impaired people;
    hearing impaired people;
    older adults.

    Older adults were very interested by this new application of
technology, were not intimidated by it and even expressed a desire to
co-operate in this kind of experiment right from the design stage, so that
their needs would be better understood.

    Seniors' reactions indicated that the VCN should take account of the
following:
    voice clarity and volume (there is no preference for male or female
    voices);
    display time (displays are easier to read if they last longer);
    there should be fewer advertising messages and they should not go so
    fast;
    there should be more information on transfers, upcoming stations,
    where to go to take a bus;
    there should be more practical information;
    weather and news messages were found to be very useful;
    advertising messages could be more informative.




5.2.3.   Cable television and interactive television

    The cable firm Videotron appears to be well informed regarding the
profile of its older subscribers and indicates a willingness to accommodate
them.  In June 1992, Videotron commissioned the New Technologies Research
Laboratory (Laboratoire de recherche sur les nouvelles technologies) at the
University of Montreal to conduct a study of subscriber acceptance of its new
Videoway technology (Analyse de l'adoption d'une nouvelle technologie : le
système VIDEOWAY).

    The study found that 12% of subscribers were aged 55 years and over;
furthermore, 76% subscribe to both Videoway and pay television, while 24%
subscribed only to Videoway.

    The researchers obtained valuable information about the
user-friendliness of the Videoway system, in that 70% of respondents found
the system fairly or very easy to use but that only 30% were fully comfortable
with it.  They also asked respondents about the variety of services accessible
at all times; on the time spent playing games; and on their preferences toward
one or the other of these options.

    A total of 32% of interactive television viewers are 55 years of age or
over; furthermore, 60% of these viewers watched interactive programs in the
weeks preceding the interview.

    On average, seniors consume 16 hours and 32 minutes of pay television
per week, including 6 hours and 10 minutes on weekends.  They watch an average
of 22 hours and 26 minutes of conventional television each week.

    The researchers conclude that people aged 55 years and over do not
necessarily use the various system components more often, but stay with a
particular component significantly longer each time they do use it (this is
as true for games as for other telematic services).  In addition, they are
heavy consumers of conventional television.

5.2.4.   Telephone

    One Canadian telephone company has also studied the characteristics
of users aged 50 and over in an internal survey designed to establish the
profile of this clientele and identify their current and future telephone
needs.  The survey found that:
    today's seniors are wealthier and healthier than their predecessors,
    and this trend is continuing;
    with 55% of discretionary purchasing power, they are a significant
    retail market for a number of services;
    this is a clientele sought after by financial institutions;
    manufacturers of personal care products, upscale merchandise and
    health-related products; travel agencies; and relaxation centres
    (spas and health clubs);
    these consumers are nonetheless educated; determined to ask questions
    and take their time to find the right product; and demanding of
    quality;
    this is not a homogeneous group but multiple cohorts with diverse
    interests, values and needs.

    The survey also contains information on the attitudes of consumers aged
50-64 years and 65 years and over toward a number of other services.

    Finally, it provided some highly interesting information on the
potential of telecommunications products and services, as well as products
and services now available to older adults or that could be made available to
them.

5.2.5.   Security systems manufacturers

    While this industry does not design its products to meet the needs of
target clienteles, one of the firms interviewed is developing new portable
alarm systems and other assistance devices (such as collars, bracelets and
blood pressure or respiratory rate sensing devices) that may be appropriate
for adults and seniors with health problems.  This firm does not, however,
have any way to determine whether these products meet the needs of older
people, nor is it conducting research and development for new products
intended for this age group.

5.2.6.   Home automation

    General Electric of Canada (GEC), which participated in a project for
handicapped persons and older adults, reports that a very small percentage of
the population uses the sophisticated functions of electronic devices used
in home automation and that the products most in demand are those that are
easiest to use.

    While all common household appliances could be considered part of home
automation, smart houses are turning out to be more complex and costly, and
less user-friendly, than was originally believed.

    The first pilot home automation project, an apartment adapted for an
individual with reduced mobility, was carried out in Quebec by the Canada
Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) in co-operation with the Quebec
Housing Corporation (SHQ).





5.2.7.   Computers

    Despite a good deal of research, the computer industry was the most
difficult to approach because staff turnover is high, research and
development is carried out in the United States, Canadian branches are
primarily sales offices, and so on.  Representatives from two major computer
companies were interviewed.

    These individuals reported that their companies had not conducted any
surveys regarding older adults' use of computers or the interests or needs of
this group.

    One of the companies markets solely to business, domestic, educational
and government clients.  Older adults do not fall into any of these
categories.  Moreover, the over-40 group is not seen as a priority for
investment.  This company has, however, specialized in technologies adapted
for handicapped persons, such as voice recognition, adapted keyboards and
special character fonts.

    The other company showed some interest in special client groups but so
far has not embarked on any research projects, at least in Canada.  The company
has, however, co-operated on several smaller projects concerned with older
adults.  The respondents wanted to remain informed of any proposed CITI
projects, and would even be interested in participating in them.




6.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT



    The last component of this study, a survey of various projects
worldwide, was one of the most rewarding.  These projects, of varying sizes
and conducted over many years, have a number of points in common.  First, they
are all concerned with older adults aged over 55 years.  Second, their purpose
is to find ways to apply technology to improve the lives of older adults, keep
them independent and lighten their day-to-day load.

    About 20 Canadian, American and European projects to explore the
interaction of technology with various groups of older adults were surveyed
but the most significant ones are discussed. 

6.1.     Canadian projects

6.1.1.   Creative Retirement Manitoba/Canadian Healthcare Telematics

Description

    The purpose of this project is to develop, test and evaluate an
electronic network giving access to an on-line database and conferencing
system specifically adapted to the needs of older consumers wishing to
maintain an independent lifestyle.

Objectives

    Develop a sound understanding of older adults' requirements, such as
    the nature of desired information and preferred format, when using
    on-line information systems;
    determine the relevance of telematics as a solution to problems
    experienced by older adults in obtaining information they need to live
    autonomous lives after retirement.


6.1.2.   Applications of Building Automation for Elderly and Disabled
         Persons (Hickling Report)

Description

    This is a preliminary market study, commissioned by the Canadian
Automated Buildings Association (CABA), to identify potential home
automation applications most likely to help older adults and persons with
disabilities.  This study assessed opportunities for Canadian firms to
participate in developing and marketing technologies to meet the needs of
these clienteles.  CABA wishes to develop a strategy to close the gap between
consumers and suppliers.

Implementation

    A review of consumer needs and related technological responses,
    through analysis of databases and literature;
    focus group sessions with elderly and disabled consumers;
    a survey of North American suppliers of automated building technology.

6.1.3.   Info-3e âge project (Quebec)

Description

    This is a pilot project for an Info 3e âge Centre to provide information
and referral services, based primarily on volunteer telephone assistance to
older adults in specific geographic locations.  The Centre will house all
relevant documentation and (in certain cases) provide appropriate help and
advice.  The information should eventually be adapted for use in an electronic
format.

Implementation

    Adaptation of information and references to the diversity of older
    adult populations and to the specific characteristics of affected
    localities;
    collection of primarily local and regional documentation of interest
    to seniors;
    dissemination of information;
    management by older adults, supported by local groups.

6.1.4.   Silver & Gold (Ontario)

Description

    This is an electronic network for communication between older adults.

Objectives

    Set up a means for rapid, efficient and affordable communication to
    reduce seniors' isolation and put them in touch with others who share
    their interests;
    encourage intellectual activity to counteract memory loss, dementia
    and depression;
    provide seniors with an opportunity to share their knowledge and
    experience;
    provide community and government agencies with a medium for
    disseminating information that may affect older adults.






6.1.5.   Seniors Resources and Research Society (Infonet)

Description

    This is an electronic communication and information network developed
by and for older adults and any other interested individuals.  The project
includes development and evaluation components.

    This project is directed by Infonet, which establishes and manages
computer learning centres for older adults in the United States and
co-ordinates a network for electronic communication between its members.

    This Canada-wide electronic communication network, which links
various organizations, provides access to an on-line database and several
other services adapted to the needs of older consumers wishing to lead an
autonomous lifestyle.

    The network includes various components, such as:  news, electronic
mail, library, forum, database and bulletin board.

Objectives

    Give British Columbia seniors ready access to all information useful
    and interesting to them;
    revise and update this information;
    provide Infonet users with a simple, affordable communications
    network.




6.1.6.   Project PAIR (Quebec)

Description

    This is a computerized system for regularly monitoring the status of
individuals living at home.  The system is made up of a computer, a
loudspeaker, a telephone and a printer, and includes a database containing
information on individuals registered in the program.

    When the system is activated, registered seniors are telephoned one by
one with a computer-generated voice message.  If there is no answer after a
predetermined number of calls (usually two), an alarm sounds.  The system
prints out a complete report on the individual in difficulty, based on the
calling history.  A daily report is generally printed out as well.

Objectives

    Meet a need for safety, while allowing older adults to maintain their
    independence;
    encourage individuals who wish to remain independent to take
    responsibility for themselves, provided that someone looks in on them;
    alleviate certain seniors' feelings of solitude or isolation;
    make older adults aware of the reality of getting older, which is often
    suppressed (illnesses, fears, etc.) while reassuring them with a
    service such as this;
    save lives by anticipating the worst.




6.2.     Project in the United States

6.2.1.   SeniorNet

Description

    This is a non-profit organization to establish and manage computer
learning centres for older adults in the United States.  It also co-ordinates
a network for electronic communication between its members.

Objectives

    Determine if computers and telecommunications can enrich the lives of
    older Americans;
    provide a secure, friendly environment for learning about computers;
    bring older adults together in a single communications network;
    provide useful, relevant information to seniors over an on-line
    system.

6.3.     Projects in Europe

    In Europe, the principal projects are being conducted within major
European research programs, either general programs (such as RACE) or
specific ones (such as TIDE).  Scandinavian countries (such as Norway and
Sweden) with a well established tradition of research and development in the
area of social applications of technology are also quite interested in the
impact of technology on older adults.

         Technology in Europe)

Description

    Three major projects are being conducted under this Council of European
Communities program:
APPSN :  Application Pilot for People with Special Needs;
IPSNI :  Integration of People with Special Needs in IBC;
TUDOR :  Tutorials about Users who Disabled are Retired.

    Industry, universities and user groups are co-operating on these
projects.

Objectives

APPSN :  Demonstrate the commercial potential of home support and care
         services using video telephones.
IPSNI :  Develop specifications for multimedia communications networks
         for persons with motor, vision and speech disabilities, to
         facilitate their professional and social integration, improve
         their cultural access and foster their independence.
TUDOR :  Evaluate the potential of broadband communications networks with
         respect to the integration of seniors and persons with
         disabilities in society and the improvement of their quality of
         life.  A sample of 6,000 persons has been consulted.




6.3.2.   TIDE:  Technology Initiative for Disabled and Elderly People

Description

    This European Community project includes 21 projects designed to
develop models and tools for manipulation and control, personal
communication, safety and day-to-day support and access to information for
people with special needs (Ballabio, 1992).

Objectives

    Explore needs in adapted technology;
    make new technologies accessible to everyone, without discrimination
    as to disability;
    meet the everyday needs of persons with disabilities, compensating for
    certain impairments with new technologies.

6.3.3.   Home Shopping Systems

Description

    This Swedish research project equips seniors with computers, faxes and
adapted telephones to study various characteristics of home shopping
systems.






Objectives

    Describe these systems from the point of view of older consumers;
    specify procedures for implementing such systems in seniors' homes;
    assess the positive and negative aspects of various modes for
    communicating between consumers (seniors) and service dispensers (the
    commercial sector).

6.3.4.   Elderly and Self-Service Technology

Description

This Norwegian pilot project includes two parts:

First part:
    a review of the literature on older adults and their use of modern
    technology;
    a survey of other projects concerned with this subject;
    observations of older adults and interviews in banks, automated
    self-service outlets, etc.;
    discussion groups and distribution of a questionnaire to randomly
    selected older adults.

Second part:
    installation of various technological equipment in two day centres for
    older adults.

Objectives

    Elucidate older adults' attitudes toward self-service communications
    technology;
    identify the conditions and user aspects that are relevant if older
    adults are to make use of such technology.

6.4.     Reactions

    Managers of most of the projects described showed considerable
interest and willingness to co-operate, not only in providing information on
their work but also with a view toward possible participation in projects to
follow the present study.  This interest is exemplified by the following
remarks:

    "Your project looks very interesting!  I am looking forward to
    hearing more about your work, as I am convinced there is an
    enormous challenge along these lines."
              Sidsel Bjorneby, Human Factors Solutions, Oslo, Norway.

    "We are very interested in expanding our involvement in the area
    of seniors and communications technology and would welcome
    co-ordination with you as your plans become more definite."
              Elliott Stein, Stein Gerontological Institute - Technology
              Centre for Independent Living, Miami, U.S.A.

    "It's wonderful that you have embarked upon this much-needed
    study!"
              Isobel Warren, Silver & Gold, Toronto, Ontario.

    "1993 Elderhostel would be extremely interested in working with
    you on the concept of using new technologies with seniors."
                            Robert Williston, Elderhostel, Kingston, Ontario.

7.  SURVEY OF ASSOCIATIONS AND GROUPS OF OLDER ADULTS



    A major portion of the data was collected through direct contact with
organizations of older adults and professionals working with this age group. 
To do this, a letter briefly describing the project, accompanied by an
eight-point questionnaire, was sent to selected groups and individuals in
Canada and abroad.

7.1.     Goals and objectives

    The purpose of this survey was to solicit information from groups
representing older adults, to help senior networks and relevant
professionals better understand gerontechnology issues in Canada.

7.2.     Methodology

    The questionnaire was mailed to the following groups:
    organizations of older adults (Canadian members or partners of
    One Voice);
    non-profit organizations;
    provincial government departments and advisory boards with
    responsibility for the status of older adults;
    members of the One Voice board of directors.

    A number of groups and professionals involved in research into
technology, gerontology and other fields were also mailed or faxed the
questionnaire, with a letter requesting additional information.  Several
contacts were made by telephone.






    Respondents were selected according to the following criteria:

A)  Representativeness of older adults and professionals

    To ensure that the sample was representative of older adults and
professionals, experts on questions related to aging, non-profit
organizations representing older adults and members of the One Voice board of
directors were selected to participate.

B)  Representativeness of provinces and territories

    Representation by provinces and territories was guaranteed by sending
the letter to departmental agencies responsible for the status of older
adults in each province and territory.

C)  Diversity of the clientele

    Diversity of the clientele was guaranteed through contact with member
groups of The Canadian Seniors Network, as well as with other non-profit
organizations working in various areas.  Some examples are:
    the Canadian Association for Adult Education;
    the Canadian Association for Independent Living Centres;
    the Confédération des organismes provinciaux pour les personnes
    handicappées (Quebec).

    Research groups such as the following were also consulted:
    gerontology centres and programs at universities;
    business firms conducting technological research;
    groups and individuals working with rehabilitation technologies.


D)  International participation

    International participation was guaranteed through contacts with
professionals with an interest in gerontological issues in ten different
countries.

7.3.     Results

    The overall response rate was 23.1%; the rate of response to the
questionnaire was 11.1%.

    What follows is an analytic compilation of the questionnaire
responses.

    QUESTION 1:  In your opinion, what specific needs and services would new
multimedia technologies help provide for?

    While several respondents claimed to know little about the new
communications technologies, most respondents appeared to have no trouble
identifying needs and services.

    According to 65% of respondents, one of older adults' principal needs
is access to accurate, up-to-date information.  "The level of autonomy of an
aging individual can be increased by giving him or her fast, easy access to
essential information."  Many respondents also pointed out the huge potential
of communications technologies for individuals living alone or in remote
areas.  In addition, 52% of respondents indicated that the technology could
increase social interaction and reduce isolation, while 30% stressed its
importance for guaranteeing older adults' safety.  Finally 26% mentioned
health and autonomy as issues of concern for older adults.

    Other points brought up included communication or language problems
(26%) and mobility and transportation problems (17%).

    QUESTION 2:  What form(s) would/could these new technologies take?

    The wide variety of responses to this question depended primarily on
the degree to which the respondent was familiar with the new technologies. 
While several respondents listed simple, familiar technologies like the
telephone, television or VCR, many of them identified more recent and complex
technologies.

    The technologies most frequently mentioned were the computer and
computerized systems (43%) followed by self-service type systems and
security or emergency response systems (30%).  Five respondents mentioned
interactive television, adaptive telephones and VCRs.

    Importantly, the results of these first two questions are related.  The
computer and self-service systems provide access to information and
communications, while security and emergency response systems are used to
protect individuals living alone or in remote regions.

    QUESTION 3:  What do you think would be possible barriers to bringing
seniors and communication technologies together?  How might these barriers be
reduced or eliminated?

    Financial and psychological obstacles were mentioned most often.  In
all, 57% of the respondents claimed that cost could be a major hurdle.  As one
respondent put it, "Older persons on fixed income do not always have
sufficient resources to secure the equipment, servicing and support
required."

    As to psychological obstacles, 43% of the respondents mentioned
feelings of fear or intimidation in dealing with new technologies; in
addition, 26% believed that older adults may be resistant to change because
of their habits or cultural upbringing.

    QUESTION 4:  What do you think would be enabling factors to bringing
seniors and communications technologies together?

    In all, 86% of the respondents felt that awareness on the part of older
adults and the general public was very important; 39% mentioned the
importance of training and support to seniors in the learning process; and 35%
cite promotion of the technology and education of the public by the media.  The
format of a course for seniors offered by adult education institutions or
community centres is preferred by 22% of the respondents, while 17% preferred
to be instructed by their peers.

    Other proposed solutions were subsidies and programs to reduce the cost
of implementing the technology (30%) and the development of more suitable,
user-friendly technology (17%).

    Only 8% of the respondents mentioned that public and private sector
managers (who are responsible for developing, producing and distributing the
technology) also needed to be better informed of older adults' situation and
needs.

    QUESTION 5:  Are you aware of any previous similar or related studies,
by your organization or by other organizations in Canada and abroad?
    and
    QUESTION 6:  Do you know individuals or organizations that could help
us in our research?

    Both of these questions obtained a response rate of 73%.  The
information obtained from them was reviewed and the appropriate individuals
or groups were contacted.


    QUESTION 7:  What are your feelings and comments/ideas for this project?

    Most of the reactions expressed were enthusiastic.  Many respondents
who work either with older adults or with technology recognized that such
issues needed to be addressed, and felt that strategies should be developed
to encourage older Canadians to participate fully in modern society by
efficiently using its tools.  They recommended that this project continue
over several years and consider a number of factors such as the cost, design
and marketing (promotion, education, etc.) of technological devices.

    Here are some sample comments:

    "Communication will be essential to keep older adults in the
    mainstream of society.  Strategies need to be developed so that
    the technology developed will be appropriate and adaptable to
    an aging population."

    "Technology has an enormous potential to make life easier for
    seniors.  However, seniors need to know what kind of technology
    is out there to help them.  They also need to feel comfortable
    using it."

    "People still have many misconceptions about aging and one of
    those is you can't teach an old dog new tricks!  Seniors need to
    know that they are as capable of learning how to use new
    technology as younger people."

    "Anything that can promote the wider use, by seniors, of the
    rapidly proliferating, increasingly sophisticated, labour
    emancipating, ever more user-friendly instruments of modern
    technology, will have the potential for social and economic
    benefits that could improve the quality of life for all
    Canadians."

    "Technology for senior citizens is no longer an abstraction. 
    The push-pull effect of new commercially available technologies
    is leading inexorably in that direction.  Furthermore, we must
    see the train coming and act immediately if we don't want to miss
    it."

    "Important to recognize technology as a tool rather than a
    crutch.  Hi-tech without integration to existing services for
    seniors will not solve communication/access problems."

    "Through efficient use of new technology, the government can
    save money in the medium term while improving older adults'
    quality of life, sense of well-being and social involvement."

    "We think that getting older people interested in multimedia is
    a wonderful idea!"

    QUESTION 8:  Do you believe that you can make a particular contribution
to this project?  If so, how?

    Responses to this final question fall into three categories:
    individuals and groups who could act as intermediaries between the
    older adults they serve and the project co-ordinators;
    individuals and groups who could provide expertise;
    individuals and groups who volunteered to participate in a pilot
    project.

    Co-ordinators of any future project or projects will assess these
possibilities for co-operation, and will determine human resource needs at
that time.


Summary

    The questionnaire responses indicate that older adults use CITs --
primarily computers, self-service or security and emergency response systems
-- to satisfy information and psychosocial needs.  Companies that develop and
implement them should take account of equipment cost; psychological
barriers; user training; promotion to the public; and possibilities for
subsidies and programs designed to reduce cost to the consumer.

    It appears that a lack of contact and interaction with technological
devices, rather than prejudice, is responsible for many seniors' resistance
to new technology.  The respondents, some of whom are unfamiliar with CITs,
did not seem to have difficulty identifying needs that new technologies could
satisfy, services that they could provide and possible hurdles to their
adoption.  Many seniors are intimidated or even frightened by these modern
communications technologies; training and promotion would be the most
effective ways to overcome these feelings of discomfort in the face of the
unknown.

    In general, respondents were enthusiastic about CITs as long as they
could understand why they were useful.  The technology will be more effective,
and more widely accepted, if the needs and interests of both young and old
users are identified.  The respondents did not appear to be afraid that the
technology will hinder personal relationships, believing instead that it
will enrich the social lives of older adults.

    The high response rate indicates that interest in this question is
widespread.  The findings agree with those from more comprehensive studies
that most older adults are not put off by new technologies but are willing to
learn to use any technology that is truly useful and for which suitable
training and equipment are provided.


8.  CONCLUSION



8.1.     Older adults and technology

    Older Canadians are no longer a homogeneous group; in addition, today's
seniors do not have much in common, from the point of view of life experiences,
with the generations that preceded them.  In the last ten years or so, recent
retirees in particular have become the pioneers of modern aging,
experimenting with new social trends such as early retirement; encouragement
of home care by families of seniors who are losing their independence; the
growth of seniors' rights groups; and special rates for people aged 55 years
and over.

    The most recent wave of older adults has had to adapt to all kinds of
major technological changes in the last quarter of the 20th century.  Such
innovations as radio, the telephone, sophisticated household appliances,
television, video cassette recorders, and medical and biomedical technology
have found their way into seniors' lives, whether they wanted them or not. 
Older adults have not adapted nearly so well, however, to newer
communications and information technologies (such as computers, modems and
electronic games) that still seem too closely associated with people under 40
and are developed to serve this market.

    Most research findings, as well as comments from private sector
representatives, indicate that the CIT industry does not consider older
adults as a target clientele; that the profile of this clientele is
misunderstood by those with an interest in issues of gerontechnology; and
that, too often, these professionals are still relying on obsolete data
(information and statistics from previous generations).  Most of these
products, therefore, are developed based on obsolete assumptions.

    Older adults have a great deal of difficulty identifying their needs
or interests with respect to technology or evaluating equipment or services,
given that they are not very familiar with the phenomenon.  They have trouble
conceiving of what is described to them, given the highly technical nature of
this field.  This, in fact, was one of the main problems encountered by most 
researchers.

    Since opportunities for interaction between older adults and
technology will probably become more numerous as the population ages and CITs
become more advanced, it is time that the major actors prepare themselves for
this phenomenon.  In Canada, as in all industrialized countries, the new wave
of older adults will have increasing contact with CITs.

    More Canadians than believed, aged 55 years and over, have now, and will
continue to have, the characteristics cited by research studies as necessary
for use of CITs, that is, suitable education, a desire to remain physically,
intellectually and socially active, financial means and some familiarity
with the technology.

8.1.1.   Things are certain to improve

    As the children of the postwar generation begin to reach 55, an older
Canadian population will become an unprecedented reality.

    As people come to live ever longer lives, there will be more and more
Canadians aged 80 years and older, both in proportion and in sheer number.  In
addition, if current trends continue, they will probably remain independent
longer.






    Most studies find that older adults in general, and women especially,
are reaching retirement age with more skills and better prepared to look out
for their own interests.  This situation is reflected in:
    unprecedented educational achievement, generally superior to that of
    preceding generations;
    for a larger proportion of seniors, a healthier financial situation
    compared with their predecessors;
    growing interest in continuing education.

8.2.     What are seniors' attitudes toward technology?

    Not surprisingly, given their constantly changing profile, older
adults' attitudes toward technology are ambiguous.  Seniors do modify these
attitudes, however, if the technology works for them and is consistent with
issues of interest to them, such as:
    improvement in the quality of life (self-esteem, satisfaction);
    socialization (meetings, communications, working in groups,
    emotional support);
    feelings of safety.

    Furthermore, older adults are very open to telecommunication systems
that they can use from home:
    health information services;
    teleshopping;
    banking services.

    They are, however, reluctant to adopt products that may make them look
older or marginalize them.

    Researchers have found that many more of tomorrow's older adults will
make use of technology in general and CITs in particular.  These same sources
claim that today's older users show a great deal of patience and perseverence
when learning a technology, especially since they desire intellectual
stimulation.  Their motivation depends, however, on the user-friendliness of
the technology.

8.3.     What can the CIT industry do for seniors?

    The industry must take the following into consideration:
    product concept, design and price;
    consultation with older adults throughout the process of developing
    an application, from design to evaluation (in an iterative process if
    possible);
    the usefulness of technological innovations intended for older adults
    and the conditions under which they can be used;
    older users' awareness and training, depending on their cognitive
    abilities;
    the importance of demonstrating the potential of applications in
    seniors' daily lives, taking account of their abilities and
    motivation;
    full-time access to a help line;
    but also the possibility that technology may replace social contact
    and lead to isolation.

    A number of studies have found that older subjects' attitudes toward
new technologies tend to become more negative with age.  All studies show,
however, that age is not a significant factor and that prejudices and
stereotypes with respect to older adults are among the first hurdles to
overcome.

    Relatively little research has been done on this subject, in Canada or
elsewhere.  The age of technology has ignored at least 20% of the population,
thus underestimating the potential and abilities of people who have the time
to learn and the desire to discover all possible ways in which these
technologies can improve the quality of their lives and enhance their daily
activities.

9.  RECOMMENDATIONS



    The information gathered for this study indicates that it would be
appropriate to:

    develop a strategy for diffusing this study to all research partners
    and collaborators, to the research community and to anyone else
    interested in Canada and internationally;

    establish an ongoing process, using both Canadian and international
    resources, for updating the research;

    develop a research project to examine issues related to CITs and older
    adults who are handicapped in one or more ways;

    establish an advisory board composed of Canadian experts in
    gerontechnology, including the main stakeholders;

    encourage co-operation with the government departments, private firms
    and associations of older adults;

    identify technological applications capable of better meeting the
    information and communications needs of individual seniors and groups
    of older adults, within the framework of existing projects;

    develop a guide containing (among other things) advice, standards and
    factors to consider on these issues, to be made available to the
    research and development programs and sales and marketing departments
    of CIT firms;




    develop gerontechnology along the following dimensions:
    .    older adults' human factors and general characteristics;
         technology needs; attitudes; cognitive skills; ability to use
         these tools; and motivation;
    .    consultation with older adults at all stages of developing a
         technology;
    .    awareness and training;
    .    promotion of older adults' quality of life, autonomy, ability to
                  live at home and socialization.
