 Parliament of Canada Act (oath or solemn affirmation) 



 Bill C-201. Motion for second reading 

Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton--Gloucester) moved that Bill C-201, 
an act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act (oath or solemn 
affirmation), be read the second time and referred to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 

He said: Madam Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to introduce 
Bill C-201, the first Private Members' bill of this session.  It 
concerns the oath of allegiance we swear to the Queen, to which I would 
like to make some changes. 

[English]
On October 25, 1993 I was honoured and proud to be elected to
Parliament for the second time.  On November 9, 1993 at my
swearing in ceremony I had the honour as an elected member of the
Canadian Parliament of pledging allegiance to the Queen. 

Having been elected to Parliament by the electors of my riding
of Carleton--Gloucester by a record 46,800 votes in my favour,
about 35,000 votes more than my nearest challenger, I felt proud
but above all I felt honoured of having been elected to serve so
many Canadians.
For this reason I want to add to the present oath of office,
that is to say the one that pays allegiance to the Queen, a
pledge of allegiance to Canada and its Constitution. 

After swearing allegiance to the Queen on my family Bible and
signing the parliamentary documents handed to me by the Clerk in
the presence of my wife and children, I requested that the Clerk
of the House of Commons let me read the following affirmation: 

[Translation]
 

I, Eugène Bellemare, member of Parliament for Carleton--Gloucester, swear 
and solemnly affirm that I will be loyal to 
Canada and that I will perform the duties of a member of the House 
of Commons honestly and justly in conformity with the Constitution 
of Canada.  



[English]
I was extremely proud to add this affirmation to my pledge of
loyalty to the Queen. 

Since I first introduced this bill in 1993 when it only went to
first reading, I have had many discussions and conversations on
this topic and received many letters from across Canada from my
constituents and colleagues applauding this bill which adds to
our present oath to the Queen.  It adds to our allegiance to
Canada.  It is with this support that I present the bill to the
House today. 

This private member's bill in no way negates or removes our
allegiance to the Queen.  Our parliamentary monarchy is part of
our Canadian Constitution, our Canadian history and our Canadian
heritage.  The Constitution cannot be amended by Parliament
without the consent of the provinces and territories. 

My proposed oath for solemn affirmation to Canada and the
Constitution is a proposed amendment to the Parliament of Canada
Act, not the Constitution, and therefore is in proper order.  It
comes as an addition to swearing allegiance to the Queen. 

The wording of my private member's bill was prepared according
to parliamentary rules by the legal experts of the House of
Commons. 

[Translation]
Some people think this bill is redundant, in that the oath of 
allegiance to the Queen already implies allegiance to Canada and 
Canadians and it would therefore be unnecessary to add a pledge of 
allegiance to the Constitution. In my experience, however, what is 
implied is often interpreted differently by different people. 

I think it is important to affirm what we believe in when we pledge 
our loyalty, and in this case, I pledge my loyalty to Canada and to 
Canadians, and I am not afraid to tell the whole country and the whole 
world.  

[English]
Canada, as a member of the British Commonwealth, is headed by
the Queen.  The existing oath sworn by members of Parliament is
the swearing of allegiance to the Queen.  I was as proud as any
member of the House in pledging allegiance to the Queen during my
swearing in ceremony. 

[Translation]
However, the oath sworn by all members of this House is practically 
identical to the oaths sworn in all Commonwealth countries. 

I may point out that we were all elected by Canadians in Canada, 
and I assume that we all represent Canadians and not people living in 
other countries like Australia, Bangladesh, Ghana, India, Pakistan, 
Nigeria, Tanzania, and so forth.  These are all Commonwealth countries 
whose members of Parliament pledge allegiance to the same Queen.
Canada is a distinct society and is different from other countries 
that belong to the Commonwealth and are represented by the Queen.  The 
pledge I made to my constituents clearly indicates that I represent 
Canadians, not citizens of the whole Commonwealth.  

Since the bill I introduced in the House today is not votable, this 
will prevent me and my fellow members from taking a position and stating 
whether we feel patriotic about Canada.  

I was very disappointed to hear that the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs, which is responsible for deciding what 
happens to a Private Member's Bill, has judged that my bill would not be 
votable.  

[English]
Even though my bill answered all 11 criteria for the selection
for votable items as set out in the rules of the House, I had
submitted a positive written reply to all these criteria when
interviewed by the House committee.  It told me the interview
would be five minutes.  It seemed interested enough to prolong
the interview to over 20 minutes and the attitude was very
positive.  I do not know what has happened since the time I left
that committee when it decided in private to make the bill,
unfortunately, non-votable. 

I want to make it clear that the bill is an amendment to the
Parliament of Canada Act and is not intended to replace the
current oath but rather to add to it.  The pledge to Canada and
the Constitution is in addition to the pledge to the Queen. 

Members of Parliament, present, past and future, I am sure are
proud to be Canadians and are proud to serve in the House of
Commons. 

Several other Commonwealth countries are presently studying the
need for an oath such as the one I am presenting today.  Members
of the national assembly in the province of Quebec already pledge
allegiance to the people and the constitution of Quebec.  They do
this because they feel the need to affirm their loyalty to the
people they represent.  They also, as everyone knows, swear
allegiance to the Queen. 

[Translation]
I would therefore urge all members, who wish to pledge their 
loyalty to Canada and Canadians or who feel the need to do so, to do 
this in the form of a pledge of loyalty to the Constitution and to this 
country.  I would be delighted to meet anyone who would like to discuss 
the pledge of loyalty to Canada I made when I swore my oath of 
allegiance after the last election. 

In concluding, I can inform all hon. members that I am proud that 
at my swearing-in after the last election, I added my pledge of loyalty 
to Canada, to Canadians and to the Constitution.  

[English]
I believe that all of my colleagues presently sitting in the
House of Commons would like a chance to individually go on record
and officially tell their constituents that they are proud to be
Canadians.  Giving all members of Parliament a chance to vote on
this bill in the House of Commons is the perfect vehicle for such
a patriotic statement. 

[Translation]
Madam Speaker, in concluding, I wish to say that yes, I was elected 
by 46,800 Canadians in a Canadian riding, and I have a responsibility to 
my constituents in Carleton--Gloucester.
I have a solemn commitment and I am conscious of my responsibility, 
to use my judgment to serve all Canadians, and I would ask my fellow 
members to do likewise.  I know from discussions I have had with them 
that in their hearts they want to pledge allegiance to their country, in 
addition to pledging allegiance to the Queen.  They want to pledge 
allegiance to their Constitution and their people.   

Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse): Madam Speaker, I am pleased to
speak on Bill C-201 which was tabled by the hon. member for
Carleton--Gloucester.  Constitutionally speaking, I have a problem
with this bill. Pursuant to section 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982,
``the Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law
that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to
the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect''. 

What exactly is the relationship between the Constitution of Canada 
and the oath of allegiance?  The provisions respecting the oath of 
allegiance are contained in section 128 of the Constitution Act, 1867 
which I will take the liberty of reading.  Section 128 of the 
Constitution Act, 1867, which most of us know as the British North 
America Act, reads as follows: 

 

Every Member of the Senate or House of Commons of Canada shall 
before taking his Seat therein take and subscribe before the 
Governor General or some Person authorized by him, and every Member 
of a Legislative Council or Legislative Assembly of any Province 
shall before taking his Seat therein take and subscribe before the 
Lieutenant Governor of the Province or some Person authorized by 
him, the Oath of Allegiance contained in the Fifth Schedule to this 
Act. 



The fifth schedule reads as follows: 

 

I, A.B. do swear, that I will be faithful and bear true 
Allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Victoria. 



Of course, in accordance with the law governing succession to the 
throne, the reference to Queen Victoria includes all of her heirs and 
successors.  This is the sole requirement for sitting in this House that 
is set out in the Constitution of Canada. 
And, as we have seen, the Constitution is the supreme law of Canada. 

The hon. member for Carleton--Gloucester is proposing, through a 
simple bill, to amend section 27.1 of the Parliament of Canada Act by 
the addition of the following: ``No person holding a seat in the House of 
Commons shall sit therein nor shall any funds be made available to such 
a person for the carrying out of parliamentary functions unless the 
person, in writing, has taken the oath or made the solemn affirmation 
provided for in Schedule II before the Governor General or any person 
authorized by the Governor General to administer such oath or solemn 
affirmation''. 

Schedule II of Bill C-201 reads as follows: 

 

I, ---, swear that I will be loyal to Canada and that I will 
perform the duties of a member of the House of Commons honestly and 
justly in conformity with the Constitution of Canada. 



Section 27.1 of this bill states very clearly that no member can 
sit in this House unless he or she takes this oath.  Enacting a 
statutory law is certainly not the way to go about changing the oath of 
allegiance.  What we need to do is amend the Constitution of Canada, 
just as a member of Parliament, Mr. Keyes, attempted to do during the 
third session of the 34th Parliament with Bill C-270, An Act to amend 
the Constitution Act, 1867 (oath of allegiance). 

It is clear that unless the Constitution of Canada is amended, and 
since section 128 applies not only to the federal government, but to the 
provinces as well, the amending procedure that applies here is 
unquestionably the one set out in section 38 of the Constitution Act, 
1982, that is the 7/50 rule which requires approval of seven provinces 
representing 50 per cent of the population. 
Curiously enough, we are not moving in that direction. We therefore have 
before us a bill that would be futile at best since it would contradict 
Canada's existing Constitution.
Some of the comments made by the hon. member for Carleton--Gloucester about 
the merits of his bill surprised me a little. He told 
us that the oath of loyalty to the Crown prescribed in Schedule V of the 
1867 Constitution could apply to His or Her Majesty as head of the 
Commonwealth. There is a timing problem. When we look at the situation, 
we see that there is an anachronism somewhere for, when the Constitution 
Act of 1867 was enacted, the Commonwealth did not exist.  
How could it have been possible in 1867 to consider a measure applying 
to the Queen as head of the Commonwealth when the Commonwealth was 
formed almost 100 years later? 

It also ignores the whole evolution of the monarchy in Canada, from 
the imperial conferences of 1926 and 1930 and the 1931 Statute of 
Westminster to the Constitution Act of 1982 that definitely Canadianized 
the monarchy. 

It is now clear that the monarchy in Canada is solely dependent on 
the will of the Canadian Parliament and the Canadian people. We are not 
subjected to any foreign monarchy. Our oath of loyalty to the Queen is 
undoubtedly directed at the Queen of Canada, and only Canadian 
parliamentarians can swear allegiance to the Queen of Canada.  
This oath is not required of parliamentarians in Australia, Great 
Britain or New Zealand who swear allegiance to their Queen; we are the 
only ones affected. 

Canada is not a republic where the official oath is usually 
directed at the state. It would be rather surprising to see French 
parliamentarians, for example, swearing allegiance to President 
Mitterrand. They have to swear allegiance to the institutions of the 
Fifth Republic. It is the same thing in the United States of America. 

In a monarchial system of government like ours, the Sovereign, the 
Queen of Canada, is the embodiment of the state as the official head of 
the Canadian state.  

Like Louis XIV, Her Majesty the Queen could say, ``I am the state,'' 
subject, of course, to the limits imposed by the Constitution since we 
live in a constitutional monarchy.  

Swearing allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II as Queen of 
Canada is the same as swearing allegiance to Canada, everyone having 
their own definition of Canada. Is it the Canada of 1867 with its four 
provinces? Is it the Canada that existed prior to 1949 without 
Newfoundland? If this oath had existed, would it have been possible to 
allow Newfoundland to join the Canadian federation if we had sworn to 
keep the oath's status quo? Is this a way of singling out the members of 
the Official Opposition, who want to promote and eventually achieve 
Quebec's sovereignty in a democratic fashion and by respecting clearly 
established constitutional conventions and the right of peoples to 
self-determination? 

Those are questions I am asking myself and to which I have no 
answer. We have always been comfortable since we have always said that 
we would respect the current system as long as it remains unchanged, as 
well as its institutions. 
We are showing it every day in this House, and such an oath, even though 
it can be voluntary, cannot in my opinion encroach on the provisions of 
the 1867 Constitution which are unusually clear.
[English]
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan--Shuswap):  Madam Speaker, I
am speaking today in favour of Bill C-201, an act to amend the
Parliament of Canada Act and not the constitutional act. 

The bill would ensure that all members elected to this place,
before they could sit here and before any funds would be made
available to them, would have to take an oath or make a solemn
affirmation of loyalty to Canada and to the Constitution of
Canada. 

This oath seems to be an appropriate step in the process of
recognizing our nationhood.  It is only recently that Canada
became a nation in its own right rather than being merely a
so-called dominion of Canada, a part of Great Britain. 

As our nation moved through this maturing process, we acquired
our own flag, the beautiful red and white maple leaf of which we
are so proud today.  We have chosen as our national anthem ``O
Canada'' in which we sing about having true patriot love for our
home, our native land. 

In my dictionary the word patriot is defined as being a person
who is devoted to and ready to support or defend his or her
country.  It comes from a word in Greek and also a word in Latin
that means father. 

Many people living in Canada today are new Canadians, people
whose fathers and mothers were from some other country who came
here as immigrants or new Canadians to seek a new life for
themselves and for their families.  I want to say a special word
of welcome to them and to tell them I hope they will now become
Canadian patriots, devoted to and ready to support or defend
Canada. 

I devoutly hope that they will be proud to call themselves
simply Canadians, not Chinese-Canadians or Lebanese-Canadians or
any other hyphenated Canadian.  Personally, I believe there is
nothing more racist than saying that we have English Canadians
and French Canadians and new Canadians.  We should all just be
Canadians and proud of it.  If we want to celebrate the customs
and traditions of the land where our parents were born, we should
be free to do so but we should first of all be proud Canadians. 

Two weeks ago I was in my constituency of Okanagan--Shuswap.  I
had been invited to visit the children of an elementary school in
the community of Sicamous.  They were interested in some of the
simpler facts about being a member of Parliament, like where did
I live, where did I work.  However one little girl asked a
question that had me stumped.  She wanted to know why she and her
little classmates do not start every school day by singing ``O
Canada''. 

I would be obliged if some hon. member could answer that
question.  Why do all our Canadian school children not start
every school day by singing ``O Canada''?  When members assemble
in this place, why do we not start our proceeding by singing ``O
Canada''?  I believe such a practice should go hand in hand with
swearing our loyalty to Canada as this Bill C-201 would require
to show that we are patriots devoted to this country. 

There is a group in our midst in this place who are not devoted
to Canada.  No, no, this group brags that it is devoted not to
Canada but instead to the breaking up of Canada, to making the
great province of Quebec a separate country. 

Personally I would like to go to each of them and ask how they
can dare come to Parliament to try to break this great nation
apart.  Many of us from western Canada have been hit hard by such
legislation as the national energy program which hit Albertans
especially hard.  We are paying for official bilingualism while
hospital beds are closing from lack of money when we do not even
know anybody who speaks French. 

Many of us westerners think we have grievances, yet we do not
talk of breaking up Canada.  The Reform Party has come to Ottawa
to try to right some historic wrongs but we are pledged to
working within Canada.  We are each, every one of us, proud
patriots devoted to one federation of 10 equal provinces. 

It has been said before and in many ways that a country is like
a big family.  When hard times come, it can bind a family closer
together but it can also tear that same family apart.
As I mentioned earlier a group in our midst in this place thinks
times have been so tough for Quebec that it wants to tear Quebec
away from the rest of us.  This group says there have been wrongs
done to the great province of Quebec.  Therefore it wants to
separate from Canada and become a separate country.  Nevertheless
members of this group somehow found it in their hearts to swear
allegiance to the Queen when they took their oaths on becoming
members of Parliament. 

Many Canadians in Okanagan--Shuswap and all across our nation
have asked:  How can anybody be allowed to serve in Parliament
who is not loyal to Canada?  How can people be allowed to serve
in Parliament who are not patriots devoted to doing the very best
for the people they represent both in their own constituencies
and for people all across Canada? 

Each of these constituencies we as members represent is not some
isolated island, not some little kingdom all on its own.  Each
and every constituency is part of one country, Canada.  Therefore
I cannot accept it when someone in this place says:  ``I only
represent Quebec''.  All of us must represent Canada.  We should
swear an oath of loyalty to that one great country, Canada. 

All of us must feel some pride in the examples set by some
members of the government recently when they started making tough
decisions about what services, programs, and military bases
should be cut.  They did not just think of their own little
backyards; they thought about all of Canada.  Much as we on this
side of the House may disagree with some of its overall
philosophies, much as we may disagree with this or that piece of
the budget or with this or that amount being spent or cut, we
must give the government credit for at least trying to look at
what is good for the entire country. 

Now is time for each of us to look at Bill C-201 and ask
ourselves:  If we are one country and if we have our own flag and
our own national anthem then why should we not swear or affirm
allegiance to Canada before taking our seats as members of
Parliament? 

Personally I think this is an excellent idea which is long
overdue.  I believe in it so firmly that before Black Rod opened
the first session of the 35th Parliament, I held a grand opening
of my office back home in Okanagan--Shuswap.  I put ads in the
paper inviting the community.  With a standing room only crowd I
personally took an oath of loyalty to Canada and had everyone at
the ceremony sign as my witnesses.  In conclusion I might add we
started that little ceremony by singing ``O Canada''. 

Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):  Madam Speaker, it is a
pleasure for me to speak on Bill C-201, a bill to amend the
Parliament of Canada Act so that members of the House may pledge
allegiance to the country. 

I am pleased to support this initiative.  It is extremely
important and reflects very much the public opinion I heard
during the previous election in my travels throughout various
parts of Canada. 

I come from Yukon which in this federal Parliament is probably
the farthest area away from Ottawa.  I recognize how important it
is for those of us who live in regions not in central Canada to
share in that feeling of commonality which exists among the
majority of Canadians. 

I certainly do not share in any way the point of view of
colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois who want to see Quebec separated
from Canada.  However I respect the right of duly elected
parliamentarians to express their views in this Parliament.  That
is the essence of democracy.  Should we ever be in a position in
this country where we did not have a forum to express various
views we would indeed be losing not only our democracy but the
essence of what we are as a country. 

This issue is very important to me as an individual who has
worked in federal politics for a number of years and to all
Canadians. 
The country is going through a period of uncertainty.  Many
people fear for their economic security but there still remains a
pride in what we have achieved together.  We can go further in
that and build not on our differences but on what we have in
common.
That is where I part company with some of my other colleagues in
the House who have often asked why we cannot all be the same.  As
a white female anglophone from an Anglo-Saxon background I take
great pride that Canada respects different languages, different
cultures and that it welcomes people to its shores.  There are
only three people in the House of Commons whose ancestors did not
come to Canada generations before as immigrants. 

We must learn to rejoice in the diversity of our culture, not
defile it.  It will make the loyalty to and strength of Canada
which the bill expresses meaningfully. 

There are two visions of what kind of country Canada is.  One
vision was presented by my colleague just before me.  Using the
analogy of a field of flowers, he would see Canada as a field
where all the flowers were the same, all pretty and neat.  My
vision of Canada is as a field of flowers of different colours,
sometimes chaotic, always difficult but vibrant and providing
excitement to the North American continent. 

What have we achieved?  We have achieved a political system with
different points of view from social democratic to Liberal to
Progressive Conservative and the Reform Party.  We represent
those views in our debates. By presenting different alternatives
we come out with better solutions. 

For the cause of our disunity the tendency today is to point to
those individuals who have come to this country and not accepted
what it is to be a Canadian.  This is what I believe it means to
be a Canadian.  To be a Canadian it means first that we are loyal
to this country.  We want to take walls down, not put them up.
Every part of the country from Newfoundland to Yukon is as
important as every other part.  When it comes to employment,
equity and other issues our goal of social and economic justice
sometimes stands alone in the world where the tide often goes the
other way. 

Canada is not a perfect country.  Things are not always done
perfectly, but what are the options?  An option is to wrench our
country apart, in many ways to rend our democracy apart when the
whole world is moving to work together on major problems of the
day such as unemployment and growing debts. Those are not just
Canadian problems. They are not the problems of the North
American continent.  They are problems of the world. 

In closing it is with pride that I support the bill.  It is a
very important message that we put those constituencies we
represent front and centre in the House of Commons, but that we
know and accept that our first responsibility is to work for
Canada. 

I hope people will take this debate very seriously and will
support this bill.  fill Canada is worth standing up for and we
will all be better for doing that.
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):    Madam Speaker, in
rising to speak to private member's Bill C-201 I should like to
state at the outset that Reform MPs do support a change to the
oath of allegiance.  In fact a separate oath of allegiance has
already been developed by the Reform Party.  Many of us used it
in our ridings, as my colleague from Okanagan--Shuswap mentioned.

I held a local swearing in ceremony at my office in North
Vancouver on January 7 of this year.  We invited about 175
voters, chosen at random from the voters' list, people we liked
and people we did not.  It did not even matter if they voted
Liberal; we had them in our office.  Although for the most part
the event was fairly informal we did have a formal part of about
five or ten minutes when I took the oath of allegiance. 

I would like to quote from documentation we used that day which
is headed: ``A Statement of Principles and a Pledge of Commitment
by Your Reform Party Member of Parliament''.  I will read some of
these principles quickly. 



I, Ted White, having been elected by the voters of the Federal
Constituency of North Vancouver to represent you in the 35th
Parliament of Canada, do hereby sincerely pledge that I am
committed to the following principles as I carry out my duties on
your behalf: 

I am committed to the development of a new and stronger united
Canada:  a balanced democratic federation of provinces,
distinguished by the acceptance of our social responsibilities,
and the recognition of the equality and uniqueness of all of our
provinces and citizens. 

I am committed to equality for all Canadians regardless of race,
language, culture, religion or gender and will give true and
faithful representation to all of my constituents. 

I am committed to being your democratic and fiscal conscience in
the 35th Parliament, and I am prepared to demonstrate this
commitment by showing leadership by example. 

I believe you have sent me to the House of Commons to present
your views in that forum, not to represent Ottawa's views to you.
I believe that the House of Commons must be the house of the
people, not the house of the parties.  The word ``politician''
must mean a representative of the people not a servant of a
party.  To that end, I shall not only encourage you to
communicate with me, but I am committed to consulting your views
at every opportunity, and shall make myself available to you
regularly, within our constituency.  I need your advice and
guidance. 

I believe that when decisions are to be made on contentious
issues of major national importance, it is my duty to seek the
consensus view of my constituents, and to represent that
consensus in Parliament, even if it conflicts with my own
personal view. 

I believe you have placed me in a position of great trust.  I
shall therefore conduct my personal and public life with honour
and integrity.  I shall administer public funds as carefully as
if they were my own.  I shall make sure that neither I, nor my
family, will profit from any knowledge or influence I have as a
legislator. 



Then I took the short oath with one of my peers, the hon. member
for New Westminster--Burnaby taking the oath.  The oath read: 



I, Ted White, your Member of Parliament, do pledge, that I will
be faithful and bear true allegiance to the Canadian federation
and to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, and that I will faithfully
represent the people of the Electoral District of North Vancouver
in the Canadian House of Commons. 



The document was then signed and witnessed by 25 of the people
present. 

The wording for a new oath as suggested in Bill C-201 is similar
to the suggested Reform oath in that it addresses the concept of
loyalty to the Canadian federation.  However I feel that it does
lack the very important reference to the need to faithfully
represent the people of the riding.  Bill C-201 proposes that the
oath read: 



I, Ted White, swear that I will be loyal to Canada and that I
will perform the duties of a member of the House of Commons
honestly and justly in conformity with the Constitution of
Canada. 



The oath refers to performing the duties of a Member of the
House of Commons.  However the problem is that there is no job
specification for a member of the House of Commons.  If the
duties are not defined then it is meaningless to swear to carry
out those duties. 
MPs are entrusted to conduct themselves in a manner appropriate
to the position and very few constraints are placed on us.  We
must be free to speak and to act on behalf of our constituents
without any controls being placed on us by the system or the
government.
It is virtually impossible to define our duties, making the
suggested new oath better than the one presently used.  However I
believe it is open to improvement.  In the absence of the ability
to amend the bill I do support it.  I am sorry it is not a
votable bill.  I congratulate the member for introducing it to
the House. 

[Translation]
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est): Madam Speaker, many things 
have been said this morning about Bill C-201. I cannot comment on all 
the points raised. Perhaps I could just correct or qualify a number of 
remarks like this one, to the effect that to effectively sustain 
Canadian unity, all ten provinces must be equal.  

That is the problem, this lack of understanding of the fact that 
Quebec is slightly different. We have been trying for a long time to 
make English Canada understand that Quebec is not like any other 
province. Actually, it was one of the things we tried to do with the 
Meech Lake Accord and again with the Charlottetown Accord.  
It was in good faith, I think, to seek recognition of the fact that 
Quebec is different from the rest of Canada. It is absolutely obvious to 
me, even a blind man could see, be it only at the cultural level, how 
rich the French language is in Quebec and how many cultural industries 
it sustains, as compared to English Canada. 

Quebec is different in many regards, not only culturally, but also 
economically. Quebec has been trying for thirty years or so to be 
recognized as a distinct society or at least as a province which is not 
like any other. 
That is part of the problem with Canada in fact. As long as Quebec's 
distinctiveness will not be recognized--because of the failure of Meech 
and Charlottetown--we will find ourselves stuck with an amending  
formula which prevents the Constitution of Canada from being amended to 
recognize Quebec's uniqueness, and that is a shame, of course.  

It is a shame, but only to a point because it sets us on a course 
where we will be forced to readjust our relationship to English Canada. 
I think this will do Quebec much good, and English Canada as well, 
judging by another remark made this morning, to the effect that Canada 
was a distinct society. The fact of the matter is that Canada is made up 
of a numbers of distinct societies. Just as British Columbia is 
completely different from Atlantic Canada, English Canada is different 
from Quebec. 
And I believe that by setting off on this course, by restructuring 
Canada, we will be able not only to better define ourselves, in Quebec, 
but also to develop better relations with English Canada, at least that 
is what I think. 

Basically, we must bear in mind that we are part of a truly great 
democracy. The Bloc members were elected with quite substantial 
majorities. This show of will from the people of Quebec was not 
artificial, it was not fabricated. It is not the kind of thing that 
happens all of a sudden, by surprise. It must be recognized that the 
people of Quebec massively supported the Bloc Quebecois and this is a 
reality that we respect and live by.  
If we at least want to respect the democratic principle, we must 
recognize the legitimacy of the Bloc Quebecois as representative of the 
distinct character of Quebec here in the House of Commons.  This is not 
to insult anyone.  This is not to irritate English Canadian 
nationalists--on the contrary, I find it is a very fine thing to affirm 
the beauties and virtues of English Canada.  Is that opposed to 
recognizing the distinctiveness of Quebec?  I think not.
Someone mentioned the diversity of Canada.  I too am a great 
believer in it.  Furthermore, it is a principle found in nature, all the 
diversity found in gardens--there are many examples of it.  Indeed, 
diversity is a richness.  That is what nature teaches us and of course 
we in Canada have great diversity. 

However, this government, like previous governments, has tried 
instead to make Canada uniform.  I think that is a bad idea.  I think 
that it is very good to recognize the diversity of Canada, since it 
makes our country richer. 

The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):  I recognize the hon. member for 
Carleton--Gloucester and add that by exercising his right to reply, he 
will close the debate. 

Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton--Gloucester):  Madam Speaker, thank 
you for letting me reply at the end of the debate.  I would like to 
challenge the sense of loyalty of all Canadian members of the House 
present here today.  I ask that we waive the Standing Orders of the 
House, as I will move at the end of my reply, so that we can vote on my 
bill. 

[English]
What a wonderful opportunity to have MPs declare publicly that
yes, they want to vote on my private member's bill, to swear
allegiance not only to the Queen but also to Canada, Canadians
and the Constitution, and that they are loyal and patriotic
citizens. 

[Translation]
A few minutes ago, the member for Bellechasse made a presentation 
on the legal aspect of my bill.  He took us into the history of Canada 
in 1867 and spoke about the Constitution and Queen Victoria and all the 
regulations of 1867.  He overlooked all the changes to the Constitution 
since 1867.  He overlooked the repatriation of the Constitution in 1982. 

Above all, the member for Bellechasse did not mention that in 1976, 
I believe, in Quebec, Premier René Lévesque wanted to respect the 
Constitution, as I do and all hon. members here, especially the member 
for Bellechasse and the other members of the Bloc Quebecois, wanted to 
tell us they do want to respect the Constitution.  With reference to the 
Constitution, the then-premier, who was a member of the Parti Quebecois, 
added that once elected to the Parliament of Canada or a provincial 
legislature--the Quebec members in the Quebec legislature would swear 
allegiance to Quebecers and to the Constitution of Quebec.
I congratulate the former premier for that.  Why not? 

Members of the Bloc Quebecois were elected to the federal 
Parliament.  Very often they seem to forget that they are not members of 
the Quebec provincial legislature, which I esteem and respect greatly, 
but members of the Canadian or national or federal legislature, let them 
choose the term they like. 

They have come here to help make life in Canada better, and let me
make an aside on this point.  I often hear members of the Bloc
Quebecois refer to French Canada, to English Canada, to Quebec, but
what is English Canada?  I would say to them that it includes the
province of Quebec.  What is French Canada?  It includes Quebec and
also Ontario, New Brunswick, the Yukon, the territories, the other
provinces, all of us. 

We must be proud of being Canadians and I challenge all members of 
this House today. 

In closing, I invoke the Standing Orders of the House which allow 
me, as a member, proud to be what I am, a Franco-Ontarian, a French 
Canadian, or if Reform Party members prefer, a French-speaking Canadian, 
a fourth-generation Franco-Ontarian whose ancestors came from France in 
the 17th century, and challenge all my colleagues here in the House to 
let me have a vote on this bill by overriding the Standing Orders.  We 
can do so with unanimous agreement and I challenge the patriotism and 
loyalty to Canada of all members of this House. 

Long live Canada!  Long live Canadians! 

The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):  Can the member for
Carleton--Gloucester move a motion in the House?  Does the House agree
to allow the member to present his motion? 

Some hon. members:  No. 

Mr. Bellemare:  Only members of the Bloc Quebecois said no to the 
country. 

The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):  The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 

Pursuant to Standing Order 96(1), the item is dropped from the 
Order Paper.

      Allotted Day--The Budget



Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge) moved:

  Motion



That this House declare 
that the Budget plan of this government is not a solution to Canada's debt 
and deficit problem and therefore request the government to:



(a) place a moratorium on all new spending programs announced in the 
Budget such as Youth Services Corps, Court Challenges Program, Residential 
Rehabilitation Assistance Plan, Engineers Program, and Infrastructure 
Program;

(b) establish effective spending caps in cooperation with all parties 
of this House;

(c) produce quarterly reports on the progress being made on deficit 
reduction; and

(d) commit to immediate corrective action using a spending 
contingency plan developed in consultation with all parties in the House.


He said:  Madam Speaker, I rise today only three short weeks
since the budget was presented to the House of Commons.  Those
three weeks have been very significant.  Today we want to
evaluate that budget in light of some of the recent economic
changes and events that have occurred.  It is on this basis that
I move the motion before the House. 

Reformers have objected to the lack of true cuts in the budget.
We have said that it does not go far enough and we still hold to
that criticism.  To our ministers currently at the G-7 conference
to attempt to create job opportunities, jobs in Canada, jobs in
North America and throughout the world, the message today must be
very clear to them that it is not the government that will create
jobs but rather a matter of the economy being able to have the
circumstances in which jobs can be created without the
intervention of government. 

The budget that was presented to us three weeks ago is already
off track.  Assumptions and calculations done in the budget are
no longer relevant.  Today in light of that I would like to
examine the budget with three factors in mind.  I believe it is
time we look again and rethink our responsibilities in the House
of Commons. 

First, I want to examine the revenue predictions and ask a
question.  Is it prudent today to expect the type of revenue
forecast that is in the budget? 

Second, I want to examine interest rate assumptions.  I ask is
it prudent today to expect the type of interest rate forecasts in
the budget? 

Third, I want to examine the question of what is the true
deficit.  Have we been presented with the true picture in the
House and as Canadians? 

As Canadians we felt that we were misled.  We thought the
deficit was $38 billion; then it was projected to be $45 billion.
Someone is misleading us.  Therefore, it is very prudent that we
ask is it prudent today to believe the deficit numbers that were
presented to us by the Liberal government? 

I would like to look at each one of these questions.  I am
certain the answer is no to each one, but I believe it is time
that we look at each one with greater detail, realism and
sincerity in this assembly. 

First is the issue of the unrealistic revenue assumptions
presented to us.  Forecasting fantastic growth in government
revenues is certainly not a recent phenomenon.  The former
Conservative government consistently predicted revenues far in
excess of what it ever collected.   Knowing this, the Liberals in
the budget promised that their budget would be the end of those
unrealistic assumptions.  They pledged to come clean with
Canadians. 

What are the facts?  Robert Fairholm of the forecasting firm DRI
Canada said recently: ``The government is saying that revenue
growth will exceed the growth in the economy by roughly 22.5 per
cent.  This is optimistic''.   If we examine the growth of
revenues coming out of the 1982 recession we find that tax
revenues increased just over 8 per cent faster than the economy.
The finance minister stood in the House and promised that he
would come clean to Canadians.  He now says that the revenues
will grow 22.5 per cent faster than the economy.  That is
unrealistic.  It is blatant wishful thinking.  I wonder where the
numbers come from.
There is no indication that we will grow out of this recession
as fast as we escaped the recession of 1982.  Because of massive
public debt and deficits our growth out of the recession is
absolutely hampered.  To expect revenues to grow faster than they
did coming out of the 1982 recession is foolhardy.  The finance
minister is playing games with Canadians. 

We have not seen a change in the way government predicts
revenue.  The finance minister is following in the footsteps of
his predecessors.  I am sure if Mr. Wilson or Mr. Mazankowski
were in the House they would be very proud of the way the budget
is playing itself out.  They would be very proud and very pleased
to see that the pattern is the same. 

It is right to ask: Is it prudent today to expect the types of
revenue forecasts that were in the budget? The answer is clearly
no, it is not. 

Second, I would like to look at the interest rate assumptions.
We must understand exactly what an increase in interest rates
really means.  For every 1 per cent that interests rates on our
debt increase, that translates into $1.7 billion in increased
interest rates on a yearly basis for the Canadian taxpayer. That
is a significant amount, $1.7 billion per year with a 1 per cent
interest rate. 

We must recognize that just a 1 per cent increase would wipe out
the net savings that the Liberals have claimed in the budget.
Also we must recognize we are very dependent on these interest
rates because our debt is so massive. 

In the budget the Minister of Finance assumed that short term
interest rates would be 4.5 per cent and that long term rates
would be 6.4 per cent in 1994.  What are the facts?  Today the
short term rates are just above 4 per cent and are rising and the
long term rates are already one full point above the minister's
predictions.  These rates must be sustained.  If sustained, it
will cost anywhere between $2 billion to $3 billion in the budget
so that the final outcome will mean a greater deficit for
certain. 

Where will the minister get this revenue?  How will we come to a
point at which we only have a $39.7 billion deficit as projected
when we have not taken into consideration these interest rates?
What are the markets saying about future interest rates?  Are
these increases just a temporary measure or an indication of
future trends? 

Sherry Cooper, chief economist of Burns Fry, said as early as
last week that the government's projections look suspect.  If the
term structure of interest rates is the best indicator of long
term rates, as is commonly understood, then the predictions that
long term rates will fall are clearly hogwash.  Our current term
structure would indicate that rates are on a slow but steady
climb up, not down, as predicted in the budget. 

One of the other factors we have to consider, and it has not
been talked about in the House of Commons, is the Quebec factor
and the influence that will have not only on interest rates of
the upcoming fiscal budget but certainly on a longer term basis
on budgeting in the future. 

I am not any more pleased with the prospect of further
constitutional wrangling than the government or anyone else in
Canada.  However I have the courage to stand today in the House
and say that whatever the outcome, the uncertainty created by the
separatists who want to tear our great country apart, who want to
break us down, will affect our markets and will affect interest
rates. 
We must recognize that uncertainty is the enemy of the financial
markets.  Uncertainty is the enemy of the budget that we are
examining today after three weeks.
Let us look at some facts about interest rates and the various
effects of constitutional discussions or constitutional
wrangling.  How does that type of environment affect interest
rates and the value of our Canadian dollar?  I would like to make
a couple of quotes. 

First, Scotia McLeod had this to say following the debates:
``During the key weeks of the Charlottetown constitutional
discussions, the spread between 10 year Canada and U.S.
government bonds rose sharply.  The rate on 91 day T-bills jumped
from 4.6 per cent to 7.9 per cent and the Canadian dollar dove
from 85.4 to 80.0 U.S.''  This is a significant shift. 

If this type of uncertainty and this circumstance were created
and continued and applicable here today, a 3 per cent rise in
rates would translate into $5.1 billion of increased interest
costs because of constitutional wrangling.  That would occur over
a one year period in a fiscal budget. 

We have every reason to believe that the upcoming Quebec
question will be more severe and more drawn out than the recent
Meech Lake and Charlottetown fiascos.  There are two things I
would like to bring to our attention.  First, the potential
separation of Quebec will undoubtedly have a much more
devastating short term effect on Canada than the passage or
failure of the Charlottetown accord.  There is no question about
that. 

Second and most important, the debate will be more prolonged and
certainly delayed in terms of a crisis circumstance. 

Mr. Parizeau, the leader in Quebec, has said that if he is
elected he would hold a referendum within six months or a year.
That translates into a significant period of uncertainty and,
more important, it will have a significant effect on the 1994-95
budget before us. 

As Reformers, how do we feel about this matter?  I want to put
on record so that it is very clear t;hat we do not want all that
constitutional wrangling.  We believe that Quebec should continue
to be a part of Canada and that we fully expect Quebecers to see
the benefits of staying in Canada.  We will do everything we can
to get that message across clearly and concisely.  We reject any
divisive message of either the Leader of the Opposition or Mr.
Parizeau.  We will do everything on our part to ensure that
Quebec stays as part of this nation. 

I ask the Minister of Finance today, considering the potential
of the Quebec circumstance and considering other circumstances,
what provisions he has made for this potentially explosive and
expensive issue in the budget before us in the House. 

When this issue creates a significant jump in rates and if that
jump is sustained, we recognize and we all know that it will cost
our federal treasury untold billions of dollars, not millions,
which we cannot afford at this time.  We should take this matter
into consideration.  That is the reason that this motion is
before this assembly today.  It is so we can rethink our
position, re-entrench what we are doing and be ready for any type
of critical circumstance that may befall us. 

I want to make a final point with regard to interest rates and
the interest rate spread between Canada and the U.S.  The spread
between Canadian and American rates indicates the confidence in
one economy relative to the other.  When investors lose
confidence in Canada or in their Minister of Finance it is
reflected in increased costs of borrowing relative to our major
partner.
The real question is:  Did the budget increase the confidence of
markets in the economy of Canada?  Despite the reserved
acceptance by the markets these questions should be asked as
well:  How are investors voting with their money?  What are
investors doing at the present time?  Are we watching that?  Has
the finance minister got his finger on where our Canadian
investment money is going? 

As I examine those questions the news is not good.  Canadians
have been investing abroad in increased numbers due to taxation
and lack of confidence in the government's dealing with the debt
and deficit question. 

International investors are moving away from Canada to lower
risk investments.  This has been occurring with greater
significance in recent years, especially the last quarter of 1993
and into the early part of 1994.  We can blame the latter
government for this, and we should, but we also must take
responsibility currently with the budget before us in this
assembly. 

What are further facts about this budget in terms of confidence?
What can we say it has done for confidence?  How are the
investors voting with their dollars? 

I quote a couple of people, first, Robert Palombi, senior
economist with MMS International who said this recently: 



The cracks in investor confidence are beginning to show. 
Despite the increase in bond yields, buyers were not attracted. 
This does not suggest the financial markets have confidence in
lower Canadian rates or tighter Canada-U.S. yield spreads.  This
is why Martin's deficit projections are questionable. 



The Financial Post pointed out as early as February 24: 



Canadian markets have been hit hard by the recent hike in U.S.
interest rates, despite a lower inflation rate and weaker
economy.  This is a sign that foreigners are selling our bonds,
continuing a trend that started in the fourth quarter of last
year--A post-budget widening of 10 year Canada-U.S. yield
spreads suggests U.S. investors are the ones pulling out of
Canada, a big concern since the size of the U.S. holdings now
rivals that of the Japanese. 



Clearly the 1994-95 budget is no solution to the confidence
required in the Canadian economy.  Despite calm assurances from
the financial community, investors are telling the story with
their money.  They are losing confidence in the ability of Canada
to deal with its debt and deficit and the budget gives them no
reason to regain that confidence.  I ask this question: Is it
prudent today to expect the types of interest rates forecast in
the budget? 

To this question I have to say the answer is no.  The market
since the budget has destroyed the interest rate assumptions. The
Quebec question is never raised, never mind dealt with in the
budget, and the budget has done absolutely nothing to build
investor confidence which will create the necessary jobs. 

I would like to talk about the fudging of numbers.  What are the
facts here?  I pointed out very clearly in that section of my
remarks that the government projections of $39.7 billion will not
hold.  It will most likely be more like the current budget.  The
deficit will be $43.7 billion.  I point out that this is not
acceptable and it should be dealt with. 

On all three of my questions with regard to revenue projections,
interest rate projections, and whether the deficit projections
are accurate, I want to say no, no, no, on all three counts. They
are unrealistic revenue assumptions, unrealistic interest rate
projections, and the Liberals have misled the people in terms of
the numbers.
[Translation]
[Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe--Bagot): Madam Speaker, I want 
to make a brief comment to bring out two points. First, I agree with the 
hon. member for Lethbridge when he says that the budget does nothing to 
reduce Canada's deficit and excessive debt. Indeed, in spite of 
unacceptable cuts of $7.5 billion which will affect the unemployed, the 
poor and the elderly, we will end up with a record deficit which will 
probably exceed even the least optimistic forecasts of about $45 
billion. 

However, I do not agree with the hon. member when he dares say that 
the gap between Canadian and American interest rates, as well as the 
difference in the two economies, are attributable to the fact that there 
is a sovereignist movement in Quebec. I also disagree when he claims 
that our bad financial situation and the sudden fluctuations in our 
interest rates are due to the existence of that movement.  

I want to remind him that, during the debate surrounding the 
Charlottetown Accord, in the fall of 1992, the rise of interest rates 
and the lowering of Canada's credit rating were not due to the presence 
of sovereignists, but to the catastrophic situation of Canadian public 
finances and the inability of federalists like the hon. member to 
control government finances and the economic future of Quebec and 
Canada. This is the real problem. 

If we go back to 1992 and 1993, we see that the problem is also due 
to the chronic inability of the Ontario government to control excessive 
spending, which had the effect of hurting Canada's reputation, and not 
only Ontario's, with foreign investors. The problem of interest rates 
and the economy in general is much more related to government finances 
than to the presence of a sovereignist movement. In fact, this is the 
real source of the problem. 

To think and speak like the hon. member for Lethbridge is to bury 
one's head in the sand. And this kind of excessive talk, which stirs up 
emotions and is pure misinformation, will scare away investors, who will 
think that Canadians are not serious. 

[English]
Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):  Madam Speaker, I say to my
colleague that constitutional wrangling in the past has had a
major effect on interest rates, and that is realistic. 

The debate on the Constitution will take place in 1994.  An
election is going to take place in Quebec in that period of time.
If Mr. Parizeau is successful the sequence will be a referendum
following that and there will be a lot of tug and pull between
the federalists and the separatists. 

Investors are going to ask themselves whether they really want
to invest in Canada.  Interest rates will most likely increase.
For every 1 per cent rise in interest rates on the debt, which is
over $500 billion, it costs Canadians $1.7 billion.  That will
increase the deficit projections in the budget.  Other factors
have to be taken into consideration.  All of it is stress and
strain not only on the budget but the Canadian economic
circumstance.  That is the way it is. 

It is not looking at the circumstances if I have my head in the
sand.  I am looking realistically at what is going to happen in
the Canadian political system in the next few short months. 

[Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant):  Madam Speaker, I would like
to comment on the hon. member's statements.  He is talking about
his sense of realism. 

I would like to share with him that yesterday morning at nine
o'clock I received a call from a constituent who said that the
government's budget is working.  He is an individual who looks
for investment for Canadian projects.  He says we are turning the
corner, that Canadians are showing a strong interest in spending
money here and that the confidence of Canadian investors is
increasing and growing rapidly as a result of the government's
presence and policies. 

When it comes to the issue of Quebec, I would say to the hon.
member that we are not looking toward a future of doom and gloom.
We believe the people of Quebec want what every other Canadian
wants: a good job.
By focusing on projects like the Canadian youth service corps
and the infrastructure program we are telling the people of
Quebec that yes, they should have confidence in the government
because we are here to do what it is they want and that is find
the people jobs. 

Finally I would like to say that I have had meetings with people
in my riding particularly with regard to the infrastructure
program and the Canada youth service corps.  The degree of
interest and desire for those programs is phenomenal. There is a
sense we cannot stand back, do nothing and just look at numbers. 
As a government we have to find opportunities to create work in
the short, medium and long term.  I believe the programs we have
outlined in the budget are going to do just that. 

Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):  Madam Speaker, I certainly hope
there is that optimism and things will happen but the Reform
Party believes that we must deal with the yearly deficit so that
we get the cost of government down.  In that way more dollars
will be in the marketplace for private investment.  This will
create job opportunities and give confidence that the investment
will be respected after it is made.  Then investors will not lose
all their profit and whatever to higher government taxes and
higher government take.  That is what has to be stopped and we
are trying to do that. 

[Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):  Madam Speaker, I would
like to ask a question of the hon. member.  I noted in his motion
that two particular programs are targeted by the Reform Party.
One is the youth services corps and the other is the court
challenges program. 

Is the hon. member aware that youth unemployment is very near
the 20 per cent mark?  If we cannot provide hope for our youth
then surely we have failed in the tasks we set ourselves as
parliamentarians.  I am not sure why the hon. member would target
youth in this way, saying it was not important that something
should be special. 

I am not commenting on the particular quality of this program,
but I would say that the youth of our country deserve better than
simply to be told there is no particular problem concerning
youth. 

Why does the hon. member ignore youth in this way?  Why does his
party not care about the youth of Canada? 

Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):  Madam Speaker, we absolutely do
care about youth so they have job opportunities, so they can be
independent, self-sufficient, and able to have a life outside
being employed by government, or life outside government coming
along after they create a business or have a profession, whereby
30 per cent of the take is taken by government.  We want to move
away from that kind of an environment. 

I have had experience with the Company of Young Canadians and a
couple of other youth programs created by government.  They never
created long term opportunity for our young people.  It is not
the right way of doing things, to say that we are going to deal
with jobs for young people.  It just does not satisfy a long term
need. 

It is an artificial, government created environment which is not
sufficient and is not the highest priority in terms of job
creation as far as we are concerned as the Reform Party. 

Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International
Financial Institutions)):   Madam Speaker, I welcome the
opportunity to respond to the motion put before the House by the
hon. member of the opposition. 

Let me say say that I appreciate the member's sincerity.  But
while his intent may be positive it seems that his view of the
government budget plan, the range of economic challenges we had
to address has been blinkered by deficit myopia.  I say myopia
because the real solution to Canada's debt and deficit situation
will not come from short term and shortsighted hatchet work.
Amputation is no way to restore Canada's fiscal health. We need a
co-operative, consistent and comprehensive plan of action and
that is what our February budget delivers. 

The motion before us states baldly that ``the budget plan of
this government is not a solution to Canada's debt and deficit
problem''.   It follows this up by urging four steps including a
moratorium on spending such as the $6 billion national
infrastructure program. 
I want to comment briefly on each of the unnecessary nostrums the
motion advances.  First let me step back and remind the House of
the concrete plan for deficit reduction we have put in place.
There need be no question about our objective.  Our goal is to
eliminate the deficit.  Our interim target is to reduce it to 3
per cent of GDP by 1996-97.  The budget puts us on a course to
meet that target.  We will reduce the deficit to $39.7 billion in
1994-95, to $32.7 billion in 1995-96 and, with only moderate
growth, to about $25 billion in 1996-97. 

The motion before us intimates that these targets do not
represent fast enough progress, but that view simply and
dangerously chooses to ignore the destructive consequences that
more drastic spending cuts would impose.  Canada's economy is
still in recovery.  Unemployment remains unconscionably high.
Consumer and business confidence, although improving since the
government was elected, cannot be called buoyant.  Industrial
restructuring from the fisheries of the maritimes to the
manufacturing heartland of Ontario to the farms and ranches of
the prairies to the forests of B.C. remains a painful reality. 

These are all part of the context within which our budget
decisions were framed.  These challenges demand that the
government play its part in helping restore economic vigour, in
restoring national confidence and job creation. They also demand
that government continue to assist those in real need. 

That is why our budget refused to take a slash and burn approach
to government spending.  That is why we are reallocating funding
to the infrastructure program and to residential rehabilitation,
activities that do not merely create jobs on their own but act as
a catalyst to further job creation and renewed optimism. 

The budget recognizes that sustained deficit improvement can
only be achieved in a growing and health economy, an economy that
is equipped with the skills and technology to meet and beat the
challenges of global competition in today's information age. 
That is why the budget funds programs such as the youth services
corps, the technology network and the engineers and scientists
program that will help small business. 

While the budget invests in jobs and renewed competitiveness it
also applies, and I would like to underline this, the most
significant net spending cuts of any budget in over a decade.  We
are reducing departmental operating budgets and extending the
salary freeze for Parliament and the public service.  The total
savings from cuts in government operations will rise from $468
million in the coming fiscal year to $1.6 billion in 1996-97. 

We are closing military bases and reducing other elements of
defence infrastructure.  Combined with the cancellation of the
EH-101 helicopter program, savings over the next three years will
total some $3.6 billion. 

We are renewing our unemployment insurance system in order to
make it more effective, more fair and more affordable.  Savings
here will reach $2.4 billion a year in 1995-96.  We are also
looking to change other aspects of Canada's social security
system to produce savings of $1.5 billion annually in provincial
transfers. 

Yes, these actions will take time to achieve their full weight,
but we make no apologies for refusing to rush helter-skelter into
cutting simply for the sake of cutting.  If that approach
actually worked then the previous government's record would have
been one of sustained deficit reduction instead of exactly the
opposite. 

It is the need for consistent, considered and co-operative
action that explains why we have set future targets for savings
in provincial transfers rather than imposing them overnight.
Again this is a lesson that the previous government failed to
understand.  There is nothing to be gained by offloading the
federal deficit on to Canada's provinces by unilaterally changing
the structure of transfer payments the federal government makes
to those provinces.  That simply shifts the debt from the federal
ledger to a provincial one. 

Instead we firmly believe the two levels of government must
approach their respective challenges through co-operation. 
That means consultation and deliberations before we act.  This is
the strategy the budget embraces.
I should also say that we are encouraged by the fact there is an
unprecedented consensus today both nationally and provincially on
the need to bring deficits down.  Strong action is being taken
across the country, and this will have a significant impact not
simply on the federal deficit itself but on the national deficit
overall.  That in the end must be the ultimate goal. 

Some people have said that we should simply cut spending by 5
per cent across the board.  In a number of areas we went well
beyond that and the results will be evident.  There are other
reasons why simplistic across the board approaches do not work.
This ties right back to a fundamental principle of the budget's
approach to deficit reduction.  We do not believe that sustained
success lies in treating symptoms that Canada needs to change. 

That is why we have given notice of the need to modernize
unemployment insurance and the federal-provincial social security
system.  We believe that a new design can be more effective and
less costly.  We have given ourselves and the provinces two years
to succeed and have set out the minimum savings that must be
achieved. 

This needed change is not an option.  It must happen and it will
happen.  There are due dates.  There are deadlines.  There are
firm fiscal targets.  This plan offers a real solution to
Canada's fiscal challenges. 

Let me emphasize this by drawing on some recent remarks by the
Minister of Finance.  He said:  ``We are not doing this simply to
cut spending.  We are doing it because Canada needs a new
architecture for a new economy on the verge of a new century. 
But in the end the result is also going to be to get the
financial monkey off our back.  That is going to be one of the
legacies of this Canadian government to its people''. 

To further explain our approach, I ask all hon. members to
consider this.  In difficult times would any sensible company
manager simply cut operations across the board or would cuts be
deeper in some facets of an enterprise and less in other areas of
strategic importance for further growth?  That requires prudent
planning.  It requires strategic analysis and sensible
commitment, and that is exactly what the government has done in
the budget. 

I believe my remarks offer real reasons why the motion before
the House is unnecessary and ill-considered.  Let me just tie off
some of the particular suggestions that the motion offers.  It
urges a moratorium on all new spending, such as the youth service
corps and the infrastructure program.  First, the motion fails to
realize that virtually none of this is new spending.  These
actions are being funded by savings elsewhere or reallocation of
existing funds. 

That is not the real flaw in the suggestion.  As I stated
earlier in my remarks, such spending is a bottom line investment
in job creation, restored confidence and long term
competitiveness of our economy.  Eliminating this investment
would be a classic example of penny wise and pound foolish.  It
would hold back the economic recovery that will be essential to
long term deficit elimination and debt reduction. 

Incidentally those who would be hurt by such spending cuts would
be Canada's young people and small businesses, communities that
government and all Canadians should be doing all they can to
nurture.  I can hardly believe that punitive action here is what
the hon. member really means by this motion. 

The member's motion also proposes that the government establish
effective spending caps.  The budget by definition sets spending
targets that represent the caps the government intends to apply
to spending. 

The previous government legislated a more formal cap process.
This did not prevent it from falling substantially off its
deficit track by tens of billions of dollars.  Again the real
answer to spending control is a consistent, comprehensive plan
based on credible economic assumptions.  That is what the budget
delivers.
The member's motion also proposes that the government produce
quarterly reports on the progress being made on deficit
reduction.  I am not sure if I understand or the member
understands exactly what he is looking for.  The Department of
Finance already produces monthly and quarterly fiscal reports
covering the most recent data available on revenues and spending.
Perhaps he is not aware of that publication. 

I should also point out that the Minister of Finance has
committed to producing this fall a comprehensive statement laying
out changes in Canada's economic and fiscal outlay.  This is a
major departure from the past and will help ensure that all
Canadians have a clear understanding of our fiscal process and
whether further action is needed. 

Finally, the motion before us refers to committing to
``corrective action using a spending contingency plan''.  I can
see no reason why we need corrective action when there are no
grounds to assume our plan will not deliver the objectives we
have set out.  The member may not be aware that we did build into
our fiscal projections increased contingencies to ensure that our
fiscal targets would be met. 

If the member had been attentive, he would have realized that
our revenue assumptions are very prudent indeed and that our
interest rate assumptions are very prudent as well.  The hon.
member stated just a minute ago that political uncertainty is
caused by elections.  Surely the hon. member believes in
elections.  If we did not have elections none of us would be here
today.  However political uncertainty is certainly part of our
democratic process. 

In conclusion, all members concerned with regard to Canada's
deficit and debt situation deserve an adequate response.  It is a
concern all of us in government share.  That is why the
government in its first budget took action that was both balanced
and courageous, action that is delivering results now but also
looks to the future, action that takes aim at spending where
appropriate but also works to strengthen the economy and job
creation. 

More people working and paying taxes and a more efficient
government are needed to reduce the fiscal deficit and that is
exactly what the government delivered in its first budget.  To me
and to the government the bottom line is clear.  We have put in
place a budget plan that is credible, realistic and responsible,
a plan that meets the needs of Canadians today and for our
national future. 

There is no reason for the motion with its pessimism, scare
tactics and myopia to pass. 

[Translation]
Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière): Madam Speaker, some of the measures 
identified by the Reform Party to reduce the deficit and the debt seem 
quite interesting. As far as the opposition parties are concerned, we 
must reduce the deficit.  

[English]
Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):  I rise on a point of order,
Madam Speaker.  Is it not the usual custom that following a
member's remarks there is time for questions to that hon. member?

The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):  On the point
of order, the Official Opposition has the first priority on
questions.  Maybe the member could follow after. 

[Translation]
Mr. Landry: As far as the opposition is concerned, we must reduce 
the deficit, but the latest Liberal budget raises some doubts as to the 
government's intentions.  Does it deal with the real problems? 

The Liberals ignored the Auditor General's report.  During the past 
three years, the Auditor General has identified waste and unnecessary 
spending, totalling at least $5 billion annually.  I will get back to 
more obvious cases later on, but I would like to recall the real 
problems which the party in power was afraid to deal with.  Former 
Quebec Revenue Minister Yves Séguin provided some good examples in an 
article published in Le Devoir on February 5, 1994.
The way resource profits in the energy sector are interpreted and 
defined will cost Revenue Canada more than $1.2 billion, although a 
simple amendment could have prevented this tax loss. 

But the worst part is, Madam Speaker, that the minimal deficit 
reduction planned by the government will put a heavy burden on the 
provinces. It was criticized recently by Pierre-Yves Crémieux, Pierre 
Fortin and Marc Van Audenrode, all with the Economics Department at the 
University of Quebec in Montreal, when they discussed this passing of 
the federal buck to the provinces.  The government reduced its deficit 
at the expense of the unemployed who, once their benefit periods have 
been cut, will have no choice but to go on welfare. Just a few $280 
million less for Quebec.  

We have to agree with the Reform Party when it condemns the general 
level of government spending.  Our colleagues, however, should also 
respect the position taken by the Bloc Quebecois. We have already said 
that we want to reduce government spending and fiscal spending by $10 
billion and inject half of this amount into job creation.  

Getting rid of waste is not just a buzz word, it is a goal within 
our reach. Think about it!  This government would not have lasted long 
in Sherwood Forest!  When we say waste, we are referring to all the 
shortcomings mentioned by the Auditor General.   

Investment Canada spent $132,000 on a new office with kitchen and 
bathroom for its new president, although her predecessor's office, 
located in the same building, had the same amenities.  
The cost of government travel using the Challenger jet fleet totalled $4 
million, with more than half spent on trips by ministers. 

According to the Auditor General, these figures represent a total 
cost per flying hour of $19,650.  The federal vehicle fleet is worth 
more than $500 million, with an additional 4,000 vehicles being 
purchased each year.  We could go on for hours with the list of horror 
stories, Madam Speaker.  

Look at the waste caused by interdepartmental overlap!  Staff and 
equipment assigned to similar activities could be deployed more 
effectively.  The government mentioned setting up one-stop counters in 
some departments to streamline internal operations, which is all very 
well, but watch out for undue administrative growth that might reduce an 
agency's effectiveness.  

We all know what happens when bureaucracy gets out of hand.  Take 
this example from the Auditor General's report concerning the Canadian 
Aboriginal Economic Development Strategy.  The CAED Strategy was to 
invest $1 billion over a period of five years.  Three departments were 
directly involved: the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, the Department of Industry and the Department of 
Immigration. 

The purpose was to reduce disparities between aboriginal peoples 
and Canadians.  The strategy's objective was to help aboriginal peoples 
achieve economic self-reliance. 

In 1993, $900 million was spent under this strategy.  The Auditor 
General deplored the lack of coordination between the three departments. 
According to the Auditor General, it was not clear who was to provide 
leadership in implementing the strategy.  
The departments concerned were supposed to co-ordinate the strategy and 
provide for an evaluation mechanism. 

This mechanism was not put in place until 1993.  
I agree with the reduction of all government expenses providing, I 
repeat, that the cuts in government and fiscal spending reach $10 
billion and that half the savings are injected in job creation.  What I 
am saying is stop wasting public money.
You want examples? Here is a few.  Anyone giving money to a 
charitable organization want to know whether the money is used to reach 
the stated goals.  This is only natural, Madam Speaker, and this applies 
to the government as well.  However, in this case, we are not talking 
dollars, we are talking billions spent without any evaluation of the 
expected return on the investment in given projects. 

I was saying that we are all careful with the way we spend or give 
away our money, we want to be sure that it will be used properly, but 
grants are allocated by the government without making sure that the 
stated objectives are reached.  We could at least make sure those grants 
to companies will create jobs. 

Coming back to the example I was mentioning earlier, the government 
spent $900 million, in 1993, for the Canadian Aboriginal Economic 
Development Strategy.  The Auditor General is telling us that there are 
few ways we can measure the efficiency of the strategy.  Would I give a 
lot of money to a friend without knowing what he was going to do with 
it?  Not me, but the government does.   

The Auditor General says that it is not possible to determine the 
impact of the strategy.  For example, in 1992, the Department of Indian 
Affairs gave $20 million to 73 economic development entities in native 
communities it considers fully developed. 
Almost $33 million more were spent on 296 less developed community 
organizations. 

The Auditor General is asking that these program control and 
assessment measures be put in place. It is not a mystery, Madam Speaker. 
The government prefers to attack the unemployed and the old people, 
which is less complicated. Yet, all they have to do is to better manage 
public funds so that we can see concrete results in the whole Canadian 
economy. 

In the aforementioned example, we talk about the Department of 
Indian Affairs, and the same goes for all other areas. We do not know 
which real benefits came from the strategy activities. We do not know if 
funds were spent in accordance with aboriginal people's priorities. We 
do not know if there is a more effective way of getting the same 
results. Yet, it is possible to reduce operating expenses. 

Let us open the Report of the Auditor General at any page. Here, in 
November 1992, a consulting firm did an operational examination of the 
Department of Public Works. According to these experts, the Department 
could save annually $63 million to $68 million by March 31, 1997. These 
savings would come mainly from business planning and management and 
support activities. 

The government must stop trying to fool people when it speaks of 
cutting the fat. I think there are still a lot of areas where we could 
cut spending, and people have had enough of lies. They know that the 
government will still take the money out of their pockets instead of 
reducing the big government machine.
In conclusion, I would like to examine the last point of the Reform 
party's motion.  Our colleagues want the government to develop a 
spending contingency plan.  I suggest they adopt the Bloc's position 
concerning the creation of a parliamentary committee which would examine 
government expenditures one item at a time.  My colleague, the member 
for Shefford, will present another point of view later on, but we have 
said time and again that such a committee is absolutely necessary and we 
will keep on saying so till the situation is corrected.   

It is the responsibility of members elected by voters who trusted 
them to represent them effectively and keep an eye on such brazen 
squandering of public funds. The members of this House and of some 
committees are better suited for such a task than the civil servants 
since they are accountable to those who elected them. 
They would see to it that the various programs really reach their 
targets and that the government manages public funds with equity, 
effectiveness and thrift. 

I know the present government has some reservations concerning our 
proposal for the creation of such a committee which would examine and 
review government expenditures item by item.  The Liberals have 
suggested we expand the mandate of the Public Accounts Committee.  We 
would agree, but only if the rules governing the committee are modified.  

Our party insists on giving the Public Accounts Committee the 
following terms ef reference: to analyze and examine the whole of 
government spending, item by item, in order to present to the House a 
review of various programs, with the power to gather any information or 
financial data necessary to carry out its mandate. Officials and 
political staff members of departments and Crown corporations should be 
obliged to testify in front of the committee if asked to do so and give 
it all the information requested. I think that would be the fair way to 
go about it. 

A consensus seems to be possible. The Reform Party wants to develop 
a government spending management plan, and we would accept such a 
proposal under the conditions I just mentioned. For once, we should set 
an example and agree about it. 

[English]
The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):  Before going to
questions and comments to the member for Lotbinière we will be
returning to questions and comments to the hon. Secretary of
State for International Financial Institutions. 

[Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):  Madam Speaker, I have a
question for the Secretary of State for International Financial
Institutions. 

In terms of monitoring the budget as it progresses from today
into the fiscal year, what mechanisms are in place that trigger
the government to come back to this assembly to deal with such
problems as revenue projections off track? 

That could happen on the basis of two things.  The first is the
cigarette tax reduction and the potential reduction in taxes on
liquor across this nation.  There is tremendous pressure for
that.  Second, marketplace interest rates increase significantly.
 Because of those two factors we would see our deficit moving
from $39.7 billion to over the $40 billion mark. 

What mechanisms are in place to trigger a reaction by the
government in the House? 

I want to say two more things to the minister.  First, I
appreciate we are going to have a review this fall, but that is a
long time into the fiscal year to wait to react.
Second, the concern I have with regard to the government's
approach is that there were much appreciated cuts but at the same
time they were replaced by new expenditures.  I do not feel this
really came to grips with fiscal accountability. 

I would appreciate the minister's remarking on the question and
the remarks. 

Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International
Financial Institutions)):  Madam Speaker, there are a number
of items in the question. 

On monitoring the revenue projections and the expenditures, this
is done very easily by the publications put out monthly and
quarterly by the Department of Finance.  These are published and
made available widely across the country.  Any member can follow
those projections easily. 

The question of whether the revenue projections will be off
track is a question that concerned us in the preparation of the
budget.   That is why we took a very prudent view of the
forecasts this year.  We took the lower end of the private sector
forecasts.  The private sector forecasts for this year ranged
from 2.9 per cent to 4.3 per cent economic growth.  We took a 3
per cent number in our projections and we did the same lower
estimates for future years as well. 

These are very prudent projections.  These are taken at the low
end.  It is very likely that our revenue projections will be low,
not high.  It is very likely that our spending projections will
be in line or lower as well. 

As far as interest rates are concerned, the interest rate
projections we used are again very prudent, we assumed higher
than private sector estimates presented to us in December and
since then by the groups of private sector economists.  I have
spent 27 years looking at interest rate forecasts.  Believe me,
if the hon. member would like to tell me exactly what interests
rates are going to be over the next 12 months, I would be glad to
listen.  If he did know he would not be sitting in the House.  He
would be out making himself a few million dollars. 

I guess my message is we do not know what interest rates are
going to be over the next year.  Nobody does.  We make a very
prudent estimate of what they are.  We have set aside funds to
look after any errors on them.  We will very likely come in on a
deficit number well under the number we have projected. 

[Translation]
[Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon): Madam Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the hon. member. I have one question and one comment 
relating to the part where he said that the government has set firm 
fiscal targets--I believe these are the words he used.  

Given the debt and the deficit we are faced with, it is of 
paramount importance to set firm targets when it comes to taxation, but 
at the same time he mentioned revenues.  
I would like to ask the member if its really possible to get the debt 
and the deficit under control without creating more jobs, since it is 
obvious that the lack of revenue is directly linked with the present 
unemployment rate. 

Does the hon. member agree that it is as important for the 
government to set targets, in its forecasts, regarding job creation and 
the reduction of the debt and the deficit, and to balance them, giving 
people a chance to examine the government's agenda and its targets 
concerning unemployment?
[English]
Mr. Peters:  Madam Speaker, the question raised by the
hon. member is an interesting one.  We did face those questions
squarely in the budget. 

There are definitely spending cuts but there are also job
creation programs.  It was a balanced approach of both job
creation and fiscal responsibility.  It was done because that was
the only way that one could achieve an adequate result in deficit
reduction. 

The Reform Party's program that simply slashes and cuts will not
work because it will backfire and we will get higher
unemployment.  We need a combination.  We need to get both the
jobs to pay the taxes and an efficient government. 

As far as providing targets for unemployment, that is an
interesting proposal.  It is very difficult to target that item.
There are so many variables that enter into the unemployment
numbers. 

We are looking at an unemployment rate that has dropped
marginally since this government took office, but it is still
very high.  If one adds to that the discouraged worker effects
and the other effects, one will probably get an unemployment rate
close to 15 per cent which is a terrible number. 

The speed with which the discouraged workers return to the
workforce is unknown.  It is very difficult to forecast that
number.  Therefore we could have a sharp drop in the unemployment
rate and still many discouraged workers or we could have the
discouraged workers moving very quickly into the workforce and
have rising unemployment even though job creation was growing at
a substantial rate. 

We do not have a target in that but my personal feeling is that
the only acceptable target for any political party is that every
Canadian looking for work should have a job available to them.
That is a long way off but that is the political target. 

The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):  I would like to direct
the question and comment session now to the hon. member for
Lotbinière. 

[Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):  Madam Speaker, to the hon.
member for Lotbinière, in my remarks earlier today I made the
point that the Quebec election followed by a potential referendum
would have a major effect on the 1994-95 fiscal budget of the
Government of Canada. 

The comment of the hon. minister was that we will have an
election and that is the normal process in our democracy in
Canada.  I can agree with that.  It is true but this is rather an
abnormal and unusual circumstance that would be an aberration in
the election process and how the election process would affect
the budget or the economy of our nation. 

I would appreciate a comment from the member on how he sees the
current 1994-95 budget affected by an election in Quebec and the
position of his party with regard to an independent Quebec. 

[Translation]
Mr. Landry: Madam Speaker, obviously an election is looming on the 
horizon in Quebec and clearly a major movement is emerging at the 
present time in the province.  I listened to my colleague speak of 
democracy and I believe that in Quebec there is also a similar process 
of democracy.  In the upcoming election and referendum, the people will 
be called upon to make a choice, always through a democratic process.
When the hon. member speaks of a strain on the economy, I for one 
do not believe that the economy will suffer.  The hon. member must know 
that the federal government and the provinces have been examining for 
some time now the issue of overlap and duplication.  It is not a 
question of saying that Quebec wants to separate.  That is not the point 
at all.  You can rest assured that when Quebec decides democratically to 
become sovereign--you can forget the word separation because since 
coming to this House, all we hear is separation and we are not 
separatists at all--you can rest assured that when Quebec decides to 
take charge of its own destiny as a nation, an economic union will be 
forged. 

This fact is never mentioned.  It goes without saying that there 
will be an economic union and I believe that this will be an extremely 
positive development. 
Let me tell you something.  When I was a boy, my father travelled across 
Canada, from east to west, doing business.  When he would return from 
conferences in the west, from Vancouver and elsewhere, he would say to 
me:  ``Jean, do you know which regions are the most 
separatist-minded?''  
I would answer:  ``No, dad, which ones?''  And he would say:  ``The western 
regions.  I have just returned from a three-day, or one-week, business 
trip out west.'' 

Believe me when I say that this is our goal. From an economic and 
monetary standpoint, we want to assure you--and this is one of the 
reasons why the leader of our party went to the United States, to 
reassure the Americans--that there will be no barriers or borders, as 
there were between East Germany and West Germany. Right now, we already 
have tariff barriers between Quebec and Ontario or the other Canadian 
provinces and I would like to see these barriers removed.  Quebec wants 
to do away with them. 

If we can eliminate these barriers while acting as serious, honest 
individuals, and if can make the people of Canada and Quebec understand  
Quebec's economic viewpoint and resources, we can be good friends and 
partners.  Personally, I will always work with Canada and Quebec. Rest 
assured that I will be honest and frank.  If we explain our position 
clearly, all Canadians and Quebecers will be reassured. 

[English]
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):  Madam Speaker, I rise
in response to the challenges which were laid out but sadly not
met by the finance minister in his budget speech and to speak in
favour of the motion that is now before the House. 

Canada's federal debt has given birth to the vandals that ravage
the Canadian economy: bankruptcy, ruinous taxation, crumbling
social programs and dehumanizing unemployment.  Interest payments
on the debt consume a third of every tax dollar from taxpayers
who already among the highest taxed people in the world. 

Our level of foreign debt for all levels of government now
approaches 50 per cent.  We are particularly vulnerable to
financial chaos should investors grow concerned about our
stability and withdraw their funds.  They are concerned.  Thus
our soft underbelly lies exposed. 

Time after time bond rating services caution us about getting
our spending under control.  Two provinces, Saskatchewan and
Newfoundland, teeter on the brink of fiscal crisis.  Canadian
investors vote with dollars, and with the stability of our
economy in question they are increasingly looking south, to
Europe and to the Pacific Rim to invest their money or they move
their trade to the underground economy beyond the maw of the
insatiable tax man. 

Meanwhile the uncertainty that surrounds the future of Quebec
has driven up the premium that investors demand on their money to
the point at which some analysts say we pay an extra $6 billion a
year in interest on the debt.  As always those investors are
ready to flee our country to more capital friendly regimes at the
very first sign of trouble. 

This is the grim reality unadorned by the charming optimism that
informed the minister's budget speech.  The budget merely tinkers
with the problem of the deficit.  Some mild spending cuts, some
tax increases and a lot of luck will leave us with a still
untenable $40 billion deficit.  To be kind, it is an effort that
is left wanting.
I hasten to point out that the government deserves
congratulations in a few of the measures it has taken. Apparently
it is no longer politically incorrect as it was during the
election to suggest that social programs need not be universal. 

The reduction of UI benefits for some, the targeting of benefits
for others and the subsequent removal of January's UI premium
hike are all welcome moves.  In their modest ways they will
improve the economy.  However much more needs to be done to
mollify the fears of investors, both domestic and foreign, and of
taxpayers to encourage them to stay in Canada and to remain in
the above-ground economy. 

The Reform plan focuses on judicious and humane spending cuts,
cuts first to the top levels of government starting with MPs and
senators.  Including but not limited to it would be immediate and
radical reform of MPs pensions.  This pension plan is so unjust
and so motivated by greed it is beyond belief that the Prime
Minister has feebly attempted to defend it on several occasions
in this place. 

We advocate cuts to grants and subsidies for big business and
special interests.  We advocate the targeting of social programs
to those most in need with the retention of the present levels of
funding for education, health care and the core of the pension
programs.  We also advocate that unemployment insurance be
administered and funded solely by employers and employees on an
equal basis. 

The effect of these cuts to government operations, the
elimination of subsidies and grants and targeted social spending
would be to reduce spending by about $20 billion a year. This
combined with growth in the economy would bring us to a balanced
budget or close to it after three years. 

Naturally we therefore support a cap on spending as is advocated
in this motion.  We support the elimination of the infrastructure
program and the other measures listed in this motion. 

Let me talk more specifically about a single department and the
measures which can be undertaken in that one area to bring
spending under control.  As a member of the Canadian heritage
committee I am aghast that this department was almost completely
overlooked in the government's initiative to cut spending. 

It is no exaggeration to say that no other department has more
vague, nebulous and implausible objectives than this one.
Building understanding, striving for equality, preserving one's
culture and appreciating our Canadian heritage are all noble
goals and things we should all strive for as individuals.
Generally speaking however these are areas where government is in
way over its head. 

Despite the billions and billions of dollars spent on official
bilingualism in this country there are no more and perhaps fewer
bilingual Canadians than 20 years ago.  This is a failure by any
standard.  Because Canadians resent the heavy hand of government,
official bilingualism has served to divide us along linguistic
lines. 

Despite the hundreds of millions of dollars poured into official
multiculturalism, racial tensions are hitting new heights.  That
is also a failure by any standard.  The sense that government
favours certain minorities serves to divide us along racial
lines. 

Despite the billions of dollars poured into subsidizing and
protecting Canadian culture, more and more we see Canadians
gobbling up American TV, music and movies.  Even CBC TV has
acquiesced.  With great embarrassment I am sure, it is forced to
run American sitcoms to capture viewers.  This too, by any
conceivable standard, is a failure on a grand scale. 

Just as important, Canadians are left to assume that this
government intervention must mean our culture is inferior to
culture from elsewhere.  Or again, they simply resent the
government's show of favouritism to the selected few, harbour
their grudges and thus another division is created. 

Why in the world does the government continue down this path
that is so littered with failure?  The $2.8 billion spent in the
Department of Canadian Heritage could be cut by two-thirds.
Average Canadians not only would not be hurt by it, they would
probably stand and cheer out of gratitude for the tax dollars it
would save them. 

The problem is as plain as the nose on the Prime Minister's
face.  We have a very serious problem of overspending in the
federal government.  Our country is haemorrhaging red ink.
Let us not be fooled by a temporary upturn in our economic
fortunes.  The next few months may signal a stronger economy but
to assume that the economic battle has been won is just whistling
in the dark.  The debt is always lurking nearby ready to drag us
down at the first opportunity. 

I ask the government to acknowledge the obvious problems I point
to and to act immediately to reduce its overall spending in
accordance with the motion before us. 

I neglected to mention at the beginning of my talk that I would
like the time to be divided pursuant to Standing Order 43(2). 

Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):  Madam Speaker, the media
entrepreneur, Ted Turner of CNN fame, has a plaque on his desk
which reads:  ``You can lead or you can follow, but if you are
not going to lead, get out of the way''. 

I want to speak about leadership.  There is a leadership vacuum
in this country on the issue of compliance with taxation rules.
Canadians have lost confidence in the ability of their
governments to get spending under control.  Therefore they have
increasingly turned their backs on tax compliance and instead
have become involved in aggressive tax avoidance.  Tax avoidance
takes place illegally and legally, but why would Canadians have
reached the point of being prepared to break the law and
potentially suffer the consequences? 

Let me make my position very clear.  I am not in any way
condoning or excusing tax avoidance.  If the government does not
have the income then providing services to people and even the
servicing of our national debt will become impossible.
Furthermore, if we do not have respect for the laws of Canada,
including taxation laws then we have anarchy.  Therefore the
epidemic of tax avoidance is an issue far larger than the issue
of missing revenue. 

We need to have leadership by example. We must show ordinary
Canadians that people involved in the political process, members
of Parliament, members of the government, cabinet ministers, are
prepared to lead by example. 

Many of us in this House are aware of single income families
where the homemaker babysits one or two of the neighbour's kids
but does not declare the income.  There are housekeepers who
clean the homes and toilets of others but again are not declaring
the income.  We are also aware of tradesmen who are avoiding the
GST, in fact any taxation, simply by not declaring the value of
their work.  These people need to be shown sacrifice and
leadership by members of the House of Commons, including the
cabinet. 

That is all part of the so-called underground economy.  It is
growing at a phenomenal rate.  Yet the vast majority of these
people desire to be law abiding citizens.  In all other areas of
their lives they obey the laws of Canada.  So I ask: Who is going
to lead them? 

Many businesses have a friendly, approachable and helpful
demeanour toward their customers and clients.  This helpfulness
is carried out by the staff.  Can you imagine that the president
of the company is not also friendly, approachable and helpful? In
other words, the staff takes the lead from the example set by the
chief executive officer.  If a firm is open, honest and
straightforward in its dealings with suppliers, the government
and its customers, we can safely assume the leadership of the
firm will also be honest and straightforward. 

The bottom line is that Canadians are prepared to comply with
reasonable tax laws, reasonable laws respecting taxation.  When
members of this House and the government lead by example,
Canadians will follow.  This is the reason the Reform Party has
the unrelenting objective of straightening up the MPs pension
plan. 

The Liberal red book specifically states: 



The most important asset of government is the confidence it
enjoys of the citizens to whom it is accountable.  If government
is to play a positive role in society, as it must, honesty and
integrity in our political institutions must be restored. 



Whether by accident or design, politicians from the House have
historically told Canadians that the MPs pension plan did not
cost the Canadian taxpayer any money, that it was self-funding.
Any reasonable individual looking at the numbers concluded that
members were mistaken in their assertions.  It would be
impossible to support the luxury of the MPs plan solely from the
members' contributions.  Only two weeks ago it was revealed that
in 1992 Canadians forked over $158 million to top up the MPs
pension plan and a further $12 million in 1993.  The Canadian
public is rightfully outraged at this excessiveness but are
beyond outrage when they understand they have been duped. 

As recently as the election the former member for Kootenay East
was protesting loud and long that his pension plan was fair and
reasonable.  Yet the Prime Minister has said in the House he
would correct the situation sometime before the next election.
That is some time in the next four years.  Is it only during
elections that members of Parliament are answerable to Canadians
or listen to them? 

If Canadians are looking for leadership by example why will the
Prime Minister not immediately alter the MPs pension plan to
reflect a pension plan that would be available to any other
member of the public?  There must be leadership by example.
Members of Parliament who choose to stonewall this issue in my
judgment are doing a major disservice to this parliamentary
institution. 

We have spoken today about illegal tax avoidance.  I would like
to raise the issue of legal tax avoidance as shown in a newspaper
article by Tim Naumetz of Sterling News Service.  This very
solidly falls under the issue of leadership by example. 

In documents filed under the conflict of interest and
post-employment code for public office holders a cabinet minister
has revealed he has six companies registered in Liberia among his
many holdings. 

Let me make my position crystal clear on this issue.  I am not
stating nor suggesting or even implying there is any legal
wrongdoing on the part of this cabinet minister.  I also
recognize the practices illustrated here may very well be
standard practices in the shipping business.  However within the
shipping business I ask why ships are registered in Bermuda and
Liberia rather than in Canada. 

That is just one example of legal tax avoidance which brings
into question the whole issue of fairness in our tax system. 

The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):  I would remind the
member that the tack he has been taking is very borderline with
regard to parliamentary procedure and acceptable parliamentary
conversation.  Would the hon. member please be careful. 

Mr. Abbott:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, I will dispense
with the balance of my speech in deference to your advice save to
conclude if I may. 

Canadians rightfully are looking for parliamentarians to lead by
example.  At the end of the day, unless there are substantial
changes on the part of the majority of members of Parliament and
members of the cabinet in the next four years, Canadians will
rise up and say in a very loud voice:  You can lead or you can
follow, but if you are not going to lead get out of the way. 

[Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland--Colchester):  Madam
Speaker, in response to the two hon. members who have just spoken
I suggest that the 400,000 youth who have been unemployed for the
last two years are looking for employment.   The budget deals
with that in creating the youth corps. 

The infrastructure program which is in progress arose out of
concerns for municipalities which cannot fund the infrastructure
work alone. 

The rehabilitation assistance program has arisen out of the
needs of seniors on fixed incomes. 

That is why this budget addresses fair, realistic approaches to
all Canadians.  Today's headline is:  ``66,000 jobs return''.
That is leadership and it is coming from this government.
Mr. Abbott:  Madam Speaker, I suggest that the youth of
the country may very well hold this government accountable for
the fact that it is passing on the spending of today to Canadian
citizens to be paid for out of their income at some future point
in time. 

Constant deficit spending absolutely ties down and chains up the
present youth of Canada. 

Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and Government
Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities
Agency):  Madam Speaker, before I begin my remarks in this
debate, I wish to convey my sincere congratulations to you on
your elevation to the chair.  I wish you luck in your
deliberations over the next number of years. 

As you probably recall, Madam Speaker, in another Parliament I
had some familiarity with opposition motions.  While in
opposition we would examine the policies of the government and of
course make our pronouncements and our suggestions to the House
and to the Canadian people. 

One thing I learned as an opposition member in drafting
opposition motions is that if we have something to say, something
shall we say substantive, we come to the point and we say it.  I
do not wish to question the efficacy of the length of the votable
opposition motion here today, but I see it has a preamble, a part
(a), part (b), part (c) and part (d).  I see that part (a) has
several subparts:  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine. 

If one really has something substantive to say to the Canadian
people, it does not necessarily follow that one has to use all
those words to say exactly what one means.  The distinguished
member who moved the motion has a long public career in the
politics of this nation and in particular in the politics of one
province.   I am disappointed that he would bring forward such a
votable motion.  I thought he would have taken the route of
putting something which is very clear, very substantive on the
floor of the House of Commons and then give us his view. 

I heard his colleague moments ago.  I did not bring into
question the issue of relevancy which is covered by the standing
orders, but it had very little to do with the motion which was
before us.  It leads me to conclude, and I may be wrong because I
have been wrong on occasion before-- 

Some hon. members:  Oh, oh. 

Mr. Dingwall:  Well, okay, I have never been wrong. Surely
an opposition party wishing to become the national Government of
Canada did not have to put all of those words.  It could have
been clear and unequivocal unless of course one is trying to use
the shotgun approach. 

I am saddened that hon. members opposite have seen fit to bring
forward this particular motion and focus on an element of society
who look to governments, and note I use the plural and not the
singular word, for assistance.   They sit in their wonderful
parliamentary offices. 
They eat food from the parliamentary restaurants.  They take
their fat paycheques home to their constituencies.  They wear
their Gucci shoes, their Boss suits and their tailor made shirts,
but they are the first crowd to say to low income Canadians that
they want to do away with the RRAP, a rehabilitation program for
people on low incomes.
What sort of intestinal fortitude do members opposite have to do
that?  Hon. members have had their say and as sure as God is our
creator, I am going to have my say.  They can yell and catcall
all they wish but the point remains that members of the Reform
Party stand in this House and mould expressions with regard to
assisting Canadians on one hand and then stand in their place and
do the exact opposite, which is to take away from those Canadians
who deserve assistance, leadership and the compassion of the
Government of Canada as well as all other governments across this
country. 

Part of this mammoth opposition motion that one could never put
on a marquis, that one could never get into a one-line sentence,
says that they want to get rid of the RRAP.  That is one thing
they want to do.  What is the other?  They want to get rid of the
national infrastructure program. 

Perhaps hon. members later in the discourse will have an
opportunity to rise in their place and correct the record, but I
thought when the Reform Party talks about democracy and the will
of the Canadian people, that was paramount in their
deliberations.  That is what they say on Fridays but on Mondays
it is a different thing. 

Today they want to rid us of the national infrastructure
program.  Provincial governments, municipal governments, numerous
councillors in every region of Canada, and provincial MLAs
commissioned by votes in the respective legislatures support
overwhelmingly the objectives of the national infrastructure
program, but we have here today the Reform Party members once
again speaking out of both sides of their mouth, saying on Friday
that democracy and the will of the people is paramount, but when
the Government of Canada delivers the goods with regard to
servicing that constituency, it is they and they alone who
protest. 

I suggest there is a reason for that confined to opposition
parties, particularly those that are on the rump side of the
House and not necessarily the official opposition, which is to
try to play all sides and cater to all sides whenever convenient.

Hon. members must realize that members on this side of the
House, provincial governments, municipalities, individuals,
construction companies, reasonable Canadians both young and old
support overwhelmingly the national infrastructure program. 

The hon. member will rise in his place and provide us with a
quote that says that so and so from somewhere in Canada is
opposed.  However the fact remains that Canadians overwhelmingly
support the national infrastructure program. 

I say to the Reform Party members that if they do not want
moneys spent in their constituencies as they relate to the
national infrastructure program and if they have their province
on side, why do they not do the honourable thing?  Why do they
not stand in their place and say to the people of their riding
that there are no moneys in this area of Canada for the national
infrastructure program?  That is if they have the intestinal
fortitude. 
I ask the hon. member opposite who reads his book, reads his
``Quorum'', flips his glasses, who wishes to catcall from his
seat:  ``Do you have the intestinal fortitude to turn it down?''
The hon. member will have an opportunity later to give us his
answer.  I say to the hon. member through you, Madam Speaker,
that there are numerous members on this side of the House who
will take that money and spend it on behalf of Canadians.
I am always reluctant to enter into debate, but I have to say on
the floor of the House of Commons in terms of the motion that is
before us that there are two things on which I would like to
comment as they relate to this mammoth opposition motion. 

Third is the youth services corps.  This is the same crowd that
puts their hands over their chests, stand on guard for Canada,
and say they are all in favour of motherhood and apple pie, which
I am too.  However, when it comes to providing some economic
assistance to youth in this country, who are the first to oppose
it?  The Reform Party of Canada. 

Perhaps I am incorrect.  Perhaps it really is not the Reform Party of
Canada.  Perhaps it is just the Reform Party that happens to represent
an area of Canada and not all of Canada.  That is the issue. 

[Translation]
This government's vision of Canada includes all Canadians, 
irrespective of their income, their language or their social status. Our 
vision is that of a country where everyone enjoys some quality of life, 
a country where we are responsible for the well-being of others and 
where people still have hope both for themselves and for their children. 

There is no doubt in my mind that this vision is tied to the 
provision of decent housing to all Canadians. Also, there is no question 
of excluding certain people from this vision just on account of the fact 
that they need help to meet their basic housing needs. 

[English]
I am saddened that members opposite would use this opportunity,
a privilege which I would say to the mover of the motion is only
granted to a select few Canadians who have earned the right to
sit in this Chamber and voice the concerns they believe to be
important in public policy matters affecting this nation.  I for
one would never, ever disagree with hon. members opposite
exercising that fundamental right.  But having agreed to exercise
that right, do not be fooled into thinking that those of us on
this side of the House are consenting or in any way agreeing with
the public musings nor the contents of the resolution which has
been put forward by the Reform Party of Canada. 

We in the Liberal Party oppose now and will continue to oppose
these Draconian, inarticulate, vague concepts of public policy as
they confront Canada.  The hon. member may laugh.  He has that
right.  I say to him that those who have been elected to this
side of the House also have the right to stand in this place and
stand for Canadians who want assistance, leadership and economic
activity from their government. 

In this recent budget we have provided that leadership and we
have provided that direction. 
I find it unacceptable for members of the Reform Party to waltz
in here and put a motion before the people of Canada which I
suggest is nothing more than griping at its best.  They have not
provided alternatives.  They have not spoken to the real issues
which affect Canadians.  Yes, deficits are important, but it is
not the only thing that confronts Canadians.  To suggest
otherwise is being totally irresponsible as a member of an
opposition party.
It would be equally irresponsible for those of us on this side
of the House not to talk about deficits.  We have talked about
deficits.  We said in the campaign, in the throne speech and now
in the budget that all of our commitments in the red book have
now been put into effect and we are moving in the direction we
said we would with regard to deficit control. 

I find it unacceptable that a seasoned member who has experience
in public life would raise on the floor of the House of Commons
the chopping of our youth, chopping our senior citizens and low
income Canadians and dissipating and doing away with the national
infrastructure program which is a program needed, wanted and
delivered by the government. 

I want to talk about several other issues since hon. members
dared to tread that line.  They talked about pensions.  They
said:  ``How terrible it is for members of Parliament to receive
pensions''.  The Prime Minister said clearly and unequivocally:
``Yes, that matter will be addressed''.  However, was that
sufficient enough for members of the Reform Party?  No that was
not sufficient enough.  They continuously raise the issue of
pension reform when they know the matter is being given due
consideration by the appropriate authorities and at that time
they will have an opportunity to address that particular issue. 

However, what do we hear?  We hear that if this is not corrected
the heavens will fall and the country will disappear.  That is
the way in which they paint the issue. That is not to suggest
that the hon. member's points deserve consideration.  Again, as I
said with the national infrastructure program, they should be
careful and prudent in the way in which they present their
arguments because a number of Canadians perceive, perhaps quite
rightly and or indeed quite wrongly, that the Reform Party is
nothing--these are not my words and I want to be very clear
because I do not wish to be unparliamentary--more than a bunch of
antis:  anti-immigration, anti-French, anti-regional development,
anti-seniors, anti-women, anti-youth.  That may be unfair or it
may be fair, it could be unfair but then again it may be fair. 
These are not my words, that is what Canadians tell me from time
to time as I travel the country. 

Let us not be unfair.  Let us be fair and let us say that the
resolution which the hon. member put down is not deserving of the
support of members on this side of the House.  It is not
deserving of support of members on that side of the House.
Certainly it is not deserving of the support of the member's own
political party.  I am sure that in exercising their free vote
they want to be fair, not unfair.  They will exercise their free
vote and they will vote against this particular resolution put
forward by my colleague opposite.
Finally, in closing--I will probably get a few questions, at
least I hope I will--I want to say to members opposite that when
they are developing an opposition motion they should give it some
more thought, do their homework, go back and think what it is
they want to accomplish.  Do not put it in vague terminology;
long, windy, whiny sentences.  Do not do that.  Their grade seven
English teacher, my grade seven English teacher, would tell us
that when we are writing a composition or a resolution.  Chop it
down, be focused, be specific before bringing opposition motions
before the House of Commons for adjudication by members and
ultimately by the people of Canada. 

But to say, as the hon. member did in his remarks, and to imply
in the resolution that somehow it is low income Canadians who
benefit from RRAP, that somehow it is disabled Canadians who
benefit from the residential rehabilitation assistance program,
are the cause of the deficit, that they, the weakest members of
our society, should not have leadership from their governments,
is a pretty gutless way really to represent Canadians.  I mean
there is nothing tough, is there?  Is there anything tough?  Is
there anything really tough about saying this to senior citizens
who happen to be disabled? 

I will close with this message.  Today I received a letter from
a lady who has multiple sclerosis, and she is going to be a
beneficiary of the RRAP disabled program announced by the
Minister of Finance.  If the hon. member is saying to those kinds
of Canadians that yes, they are the ones that we want to chop off
and that yes, they are the ones who do not deserve any attention
from the Government of Canada, let him say it.  Do not do it in a
phony motion, comprised of many words written by some staffer in
the back rooms of his political party.  Have the intestinal
fortitude to come to the floor of the House of Commons and say to
disabled Canadians, low income Canadians, the youth, the
municipalities, councillors across this country that the programs
we put into effect are not necessary and are not needed by
Canadians. 

If not, the hon. member should do the honourable thing. 

[Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):  Madam Speaker, I
have a very brief question.  I am very impressed by the form of
the speech from the minister, maybe not the content but certainly
the form.  I was just wondering whether he has recently made an
application to join the Shakespearian troupe in Stratford. 

Mr. Dingwall:  I will keep it in mind. 

[Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):  Madam Speaker, I appreciated
very much the presentation of the member opposite, particularly I
enjoyed his lesson on the use of brevity of words. That was very
interesting to me. 

I would like to make a comment.  He mentioned that we are here
to represent our constituents and he gave us a little bit of a
tirade about how we are misrepresenting this democratic
responsibility.  I report to the House that I represent my
constituents when I support a motion like this one.  I have had
people express to me great concern about the amount of debt and
deficit. 
I have had people tell me that they do not support the
infrastructure program but they feel blackmailed by a federal
government which with a $2 billion commitment has forced a
province to match it and the municipalities to match it.  They
are opposed to going into further debt and they are opposed to
further borrowing.  Consequently I do represent my constituents
when I say we want to put a cap on spending.  We want to reduce
it.
I had a conversation with one of my constituents this weekend in
which we discussed this point.  I did a little calculation and
found that a deficit of $40 billion is taking us into debt in
this year alone to the amount of $500 per family per month and
that is a huge concern. 

I believe I have used my time allotment and I will stop. 

Mr. Dingwall:  Madam Speaker, that was an excellent
intervention by the hon. member for Elk Island.  I am sorry,
because the hon. member has just given, and I know it was not
intentional, facts to the House from his particular vantage
point.  The hon. member should check the record. 

The national infrastructure program was not the creature of
national political parties.  The national infrastructure program
came from municipalities en masse in all of the provinces and
territories.  The hon. member shakes his head.  If his particular
province does not wish to take part in the national
infrastructure program he should have said that to his premier
who signed on the dotted line on December 21, 1993. 

Furthermore, the hon. member has made reference to representing
his constituents.  I applaud the hon. member for representing his
constituents.  I say to the hon. member that he was not elected
to be a weather vane, to check the political winds to see whether
they like this or they like that.  Since my colleague is a great
student of Shakespeare, his colleague might be a great student of
one of the great philosophers Edmund Burke who said:  ``You owe
your constituency and constituents much more than your industry.
You owe them your judgment''. 

It is our judgment as a national political party that a national
infrastructure program is needed by Canadians, wanted by
Canadians and we as a national political party are delivering on
that commitment. 

The Speaker:  It being two o'clock p.m., the House will
now proceed to statements by members, pursuant to Standing Order
31. 

 S. O. 31



     STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 

[English]
      Labour Force Survey 



Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North):  Mr. Speaker,
my statement today is under the heading ``Good news gets better
with the Liberal government''. 

I am extremely happy to rise at this moment to make mention of a
few encouraging points from last month's labour force survey. The
survey has indicated a decrease in the unemployment rate while an
increase in the help wanted index has grown.  The help wanted
index of job advertisements rose for the fourth time in the last
five months, the largest increase of the recovery. I was
particularly encouraged by the strong gains in employment in
sectors that had experienced recent declines, such as
manufacturing and retail trades. 

The other good news is that all regions of the country
experienced growth in the employment rate.  In my province of
Ontario alone 11,000 new jobs were created.  The government's
commitment is to put--

  Alpine Skiing 



Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport--Montmorency--Orléans): Mr. Speaker, 
on behalf of all Quebecers, I would like to extend today my heartfelt 
congratulations to one of our own athletes who won the giant slalom 
yesterday at the world junior alpine skiing championships in Lake 
Placid. I am referring to, you have guessed it, young Mélanie Turgeon.
It was not Mélanie's first medal of the championships either. She 
had already made the podium twice before; first winning a silver medal 
in Super G, and then bronze in downhill. 

Yesterday's victory puts Mélanie in the overall lead of the 
championships. Another event is scheduled for today: slalom. I want to 
wish her, personally and on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, the best of 
luck. We are proud of you, Mélanie. Go for it!
[English]
  Smuggling 



Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar--Marquette):   Mr. Speaker,
since the government's anti-smuggling measures were announced,
several Manitoba border crossings have been open 24 hours a day.
This only sends a clear message to smugglers to avoid these
border crossings. 

In addition, extra customs officers must be kept on duty at
night at each crossing because of the extra hours.  The only
increased traffic at these crossings has been in the form of
vehicles going south to the United States to take advantage of
cheap U.S. liquor, food and gasoline. 

Revenue is being taken out of the pockets of Manitoba businesses
and sent over the border.  Everyone agrees we should be
concentrating on a decrease in smuggling, but instead the local
RCMP which is already understaffed has to contend with increased
smuggling of not only cigarettes but liquor and guns. 

Would it not make more sense to close down the customs ports at
night and increase the RCMP personnel to create better border
patrol?  This would show real action against smuggling and would
keep more Canadian dollars at home.
  Women Entrepreneurs 



Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland--Colchester):   Mr.
Speaker, although last Wednesday was specifically designated as
International Women's Day I would like today to acknowledge women
entrepreneurs. 

In 1989 women founded 50 per cent of all new Canadian
businesses. In Atlantic Canada between 1984 and 1990 the
percentage of women owned businesses employing five or more full
time employees increased from 16 per cent to 28 per cent. Women
are also succeeding in existing businesses. 

In my riding in 1990 a former bank worker, Lois Robarts, took
over Advocate Harbour Seafoods.  She has since expanded her sales
and her processing plant and now employs five people. That is
significant considering that small businesses created 90 per cent
of our region's new jobs in the 1980s. 

It is imperative that the joint government-business committees
we are establishing to encourage small business be particularly
sensitive to the economic potential of Atlantic Canadian women.
  The Budget 



Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton--Wentworth):   Mr. Speaker, I am
delighted the government has declared in its budget that it
intends to review the funding of some 500 special interest groups
which are relying on taxpayers' dollars rather than raising their
own money.  The results of this review are to be incorporated in
the 1995 budget. 

I hope that this review will result in ongoing cuts where
obviously warranted this year, not next.  We must concentrate on
the genuinely needy now, not later.
  Employment 



Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant):   Mr. Speaker, like all
Canadians I am encouraged by the reduction in Canada's national
unemployment rate in February.  However it is with great concern
I report to the House that the riding of Brant was not so
fortunate. 

Our monthly unemployment rate jumped from 11.7 per cent to 14.1
per cent in February, well above the provincial average of 10.7
per cent. 

One way that government can address the unemployment problems of
smaller centres is by decentralizing some of its services.  In my
riding, for example, we have no unique post-secondary
institution.  Our level of post-secondary education falls well
below the national average. 

My community could greatly be supported by the location of a
federal research and development centre or some other
technological institute or agency within its boundaries. 

While I strongly support the job creation measures taken in the
budget, I believe that decentralization is another proactive step
that governments can take to create opportunities in our smaller
communities. 

I encourage our government to take steps in this direction.

 Mining Industry 



Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi): Mr. Speaker, the ``Mining, an 
industry to support'' campaign launched by the mining industry last 
September has received massive public support in over 150 mining 
communities in Canada and Quebec as well as from many other Canadians 
and Quebecers who are concerned with the future of this industry. 

The mining industry is one of the driving forces of the economy and 
as such requires more serious attention from the government as well as 
urgent action. 

Canada's mineable reserves keep decreasing. 
But this country cannot afford to lose an industry which contributes so 
much to the national economy and to regional development. The government 
must take steps to revitalize this industry. Time has come, for example, 
to look at the possibility of giving preferential tax treatment to 
mining flow-through shares as well as at the need for a definition of 
``research and development'' in the Income Tax Act that would include 
mining exploration.

  World Cup Skiing 



Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano--Howe Sound):  Mr. Speaker,
during the last two weekends the resort community of Whistler in
my riding hosted three World Cup skiing events. 

They were a great success as a result of the hard work of a
large army of volunteers, the management and employees of the
Whistler Ski Corporation, sports federations and the media and
sponsors from the private sector.  Over 12,000 spectators and
many more television viewers throughout the world saw the events.

In the women's downhill Michelle Ruthven finished third, Kate
Pace fourth and Kerrin Lee-Gartner ninth.  In the men's downhill
Cary Mullen finished fifth, Rob Boyd tenth and Edi Podivinski
fourteenth.  Cary Mullen also placed fifth in the Super Giant
Slalom yesterday. 

Let us thank all those who have made the event such a success.
Let us congratulate those who braved one of the world's most
challenging race courses and send sleds full of roses and a
hearty thank you to those who represented Canada so well by
beating some of the world's best racers.

 Sixth Paraolympic Winter Games in Lillehammer 



Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Mississauga East): Mr. Speaker, the official 
opening of the Sixth Paraolympic Winter Games took place last Thursday, 
in Lillehammer, Norway.  

[English]
The Paralympic games are the premier competition for high
performance athletes with disabilities. 

[Translation]
Six hundred athletes representing 31 countries are participating in 
these Games, which are held from March 10 to 19. 

[English]
Canada is represented by 34 athletes competing in alpine skiing,
cross-country skiing, sledge hockey, biathlon and ice sledge
racing.  These athletes deserve our full support and recognition
for their hard work and commitment to their sport. 

Stacy Kohut of Calgary has won Canada's first gold medal of the
Paralympics today.  She was victorious in the Super G event. Lana
Spreeman of Calgary has won two bronze medals, one in downhill
skiing and the other in Super Giant Slalom.  Ramona Hot of
Edmonton won a bronze in a separate downhill event. 

[Translation]
I am very pleased to announce that Canada's athletes have already 
won four medals at these Games.

  Rotary International 



Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):   Mr. Speaker,
Canadian unity has been enhanced by the unselfish contributions
of many organizations that have worked so hard to make Canada a
better place. 

One such organization is Rotary International.  I was first
introduced to Rotary 12 years ago by Mr. Allan Shulman and over
the years I have been most impressed by its community leadership
role. 

In recognition of Rotarians, I would like to share with the
House the Rotary International four-way test to guide what we
say, think and do: 

First, is it the truth? 

Second, is it fair to all concerned? 

Third, will it build goodwill and better friendship? 

Fourth, will it be beneficial to all concerned? 

Rotarians reflect the true spirit of Canadians and it is because
of that spirit that Canada will always remain strong and united.

 Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean 



Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay): Mr. Speaker, yesterday, some 3,000 
people gathered to ask that the Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean 
remain open. This demonstration was truly a show of solidarity, with 
residents from Saint-Jean, Montérégie, the greater Montreal and my own 
riding participating. Politicians representing all political 
affiliations joined in a common front to convey the message that the 
French-speaking military college in Saint-Jean must remain open.  

The federal government must not make the mistake of closing this 
unique institution in North America, which serves to train military 
officers in their own language and milieu. 
The government must reconsider its decision and have the courage to 
recognize its mistake, to clearly show that French-speaking institutions 
have their place in the federal system.


[English]
  The Reform Party 



Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):  Mr. Speaker, charges of
racism have been used all too often as a means of attempting to
undermine the Reform Party.  These allegations of course are
completely false and contribute nothing to the daily operations
of the House. 

These allegations are based on the fact that Reformers speak
openly and honestly on issues such as Indian affairs and
immigration.  The members opposite sometimes seem more concerned
about choosing politically correct words in a speech or question
than with the actual content. 

Members should be able to express themselves without looking
over their shoulder for that politically correct watchdog every
time they speak.  A return to basic values, including respect and
consideration regardless of gender, race or religion, is a much
needed improvement in the House.
  Lobbying 



Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North):  Mr. Speaker, on pages
94 and 95 of the red book the government made a commitment to
develop a stringent code of conduct for lobbyists under the
auspices of the soon to be appointed independent ethics
counsellor. 

The people of Simcoe North and Canadians in general expect
substantial reform in the way lobbying is conducted.  I feel the
government must go all the way, making mandatory the full
disclosure of fees, clients and the names of government officials
being lobbied for first and second tier lobbyists. 

In addition the government should give serious consideration to
making the costs of lobbying non-tax deductible. 

[Translation]
Canadians really appreciate the fact that this government kept its 
election promises in the recent budget. With the implementation of these 
reforms, they will be all the more pleased to see that a real effort is 
being made to reinstill political ethics in our parliamentary 
institutions.

  Ukraine 



Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of
Transport):  Mr. Speaker, I would like to pay homage to the
victims of the 1933 Ukrainian famine and make fellow Canadians
aware of this atrocious historical event. 

Last year was the 50th anniversary of the famine and Ukrainians
throughout North America and Europe held special ceremonies to
commemorate the atrocities inflicted on their people. 

The famine inflicted the highest casualties during the winter of
1932-33.  While city dwellers were kept healthy and supplied with
food, the countryside was wiped clean.  By the spring of 1933
people were dying at the rate of 25,000 a day.  By the end of
1933 it is estimated that between six million and ten million
Ukrainians had starved to death. 

Even today as Ukrainians commemorate the 50th anniversary of the
famine, the events are still largely unknown. 

I realize that we cannot do anything to bring these people back.
However, we can make Canadians aware of the social and political
injustice that has been relatively unknown for too long and
ensure that such atrocities are never repeated.
  University Hockey 



Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley--Hants):  Mr. Speaker,
this past weekend in Toronto, and for the third consecutive year,
Acadia University hockey team participated in the National
University Hockey Championship Tournament.  For a school of 3,000
students, this is a great accomplishment. 

While Acadia, the defending national champions, fell just short
against the eventual winners, Lethbridge, I feel the
accomplishment of this year's team must be recognized. 

Led by the CIAU's player of the year, Duane Dennis, Acadia had
an outstanding season; a season marked by dedication, hard work
and a commitment to excellence. 

I am proud of the young men involved in Acadia's hockey program
and their academic achievements.  I believe that the members of
this team have shown themselves to be responsible, dedicated and
hard working on the ice, in the classroom and in the community. 

Congratulations to Acadia.  It has every reason to be proud of
its accomplishments.
  Indian Affairs 



Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):  Mr. Speaker, last week
the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development announced
the devolution of his department's responsibilities to the First
Nations of Canada, beginning with a demonstration project in
Manitoba. 

All I can say is that it is about time.  We have heard a lot in
this House about the need to define self-government.
Self-government will not be defined the same in Yukon as it is in
Manitoba because we must define it in terms of the cultural
heritage, of the various aboriginal groups that are being dealt
with.  It must be an item for negotiation. 

Each settlement will be defined by the history and culture of
the First Nations people.  This is an extremely important
initiative and because of that I ask the minister to place before
the House a plan with clear timetables and, most important, the
financial resources to be allotted to this plan of devolution.
That will determine whether this initiative is genuine or just
another step on the highway of broken promises. 

 Oral Questions



  ORAL QUESTION PERIOD
[Translation]
   Employment  



Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition): Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. 

Several members of the government are attending the G-7 summit on 
employment held in Detroit today. According to a government source 
quoted in this morning's newspapers, Canada intends to submit to its G-7 
partners a proposal to put in place a tax credit for employers who 
create new jobs and for those who save jobs. 

Can the Prime Minister confirm that Canada is about to present such 
a proposal, and can we expect the government to put in place such a tax 
credit for employers who create new jobs and for those who save jobs 
that would otherwise be threatened by technological changes? 

Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister): Mr. Speaker, I do not
think that the Minister of Finance will present in Detroit a proposal
on Canadian taxation. I think that the ministers who are there today
want to look with their colleagues at solutions that could be applied
in the Western world and that many ideas will be debated, but in
Detroit, the Minister of Finance will not be making any
proposals concerning Canadian taxpayers. All that must be done in the
usual way, as we did a few weeks ago when the budget was tabled. 

[Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition): Mr. Speaker, it 
is very disappointing to hear that so many ministers went off to discuss 
and chat without having anything new to propose. 

I ask the Prime Minister what justifies their presence at the G-7 
summit if it is not to come up with new ideas. 

[Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister): Mr. Speaker, our 
ministers will talk about what we are trying to do here in Canada at 
this time, and I imagine that the other ministers will explain what they 
are trying to do in their own countries. Unacceptable unemployment 
levels are now a problem throughout the Western world. That is why 
President Clinton convened this summit, so that the ministers 
responsible in this area can meet and exchange ideas. And if this summit 
produces new ideas that can apply to the Canadian situation, I am sure 
that our ministers will be happy to take note and report to the Canadian 
Parliament. 

[Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition): Mr. Speaker, we 
hope that the representatives to this summit will do more than compare 
their respective countries' unemployment rates. All this is not very 
encouraging. 

Can the Prime Minister tell us today if, after the G-7 summit, his 
government will introduce a real policy, a real job creation strategy to 
give a little hope finally to the 1.5 million unemployed Canadians and 
especially to young people, nearly 20 per cent of whom are without jobs? 

[English]
[Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):  Mr. Speaker,
that was debated in the budget debates over the last few weeks.
We explained our plans, including the infrastructure program and
the youth program.  We want to make sure by changing the nature
of our social programs there is more money available for creating
jobs. 

When meeting with others they discuss our approach and we
discuss their approach.  That is the reason we meet with them. 
We try to have good exchanges with the people involved and thus
have as much stability as possible in the western world. 
Everyone agrees it is better when people talk than when they do
not. 

It was a good initiative by the President of the United States
to invite all the ministers involved with labour and employment
to get together. 

[Translation]
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier): Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Prime Minister. 

The government keeps saying that its real priority is job creation. 
Today, a large delegation of Canadian ministers is attending a G-7 
conference which we thought would deal with ways to stimulate 
employment.  

In the meantime, the government maintains the unemployment 
insurance premium increase which it put in effect last January 1, and 
which is truly a tax on employment. In fact, last week in this House, 
the Minister of Finance himself said it was absurd.
Does the Prime Minister agree that, if the government wants to be 
logical when it talks about job creation, it must immediately eliminate 
this premium increase? 

Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister): Mr. Speaker, this is 
precisely what the government has done. The previous Conservative 
administration had decided that UI premiums would go up to $3.30. We 
passed legislation to lower these premiums to $3.07 for the current 
year, and to $3 at the beginning of next year. So, we have done 
precisely that.

Again, the premiums were set at $3.30 by an act of Parliament, but 
we have lowered them to $3.07 for the current year, and to $3 as of 
January 1, 1995. 

[Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier): Mr. Speaker, I remind the Prime 
Minister that he implemented a decision made by the Conservatives to 
lower UI premiums to $3.07 as of January 1994. He maintained the 
decision to set premiums at $3.07 until next January, in order to get 
$800 million from Canadians.  

Does the Prime Minister recognize that cancelling this premium 
increase would have an immediate effect on employment, and does he agree 
that if this increase is absurd, as the Minister of Finance admitted, 
maintaining it is a lot more absurd? 

[Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister): Mr. Speaker, we would 
have preferred to lower premiums to $3 right away, but we have serious 
budget constraints. Nevertheless, we did reduce premiums from $3.30 down 
to $3.07 for this year, and to $3 for 1995. 

Obviously, we would have preferred to set premiums at $3, but it is 
not just a matter of pleasing people, we have to do what we can with 
what we have, and the decision made by the Minister of Finance to lower 
premiums to $3.07 for the first year and to $3 for the second year was 
the best one that could be made under the circumstances.
[English]
  Employment 



Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):   Mr. Speaker, my
question is also for the Prime Minister. 

As has been already mentioned, the government is represented at
the G-7 meeting in Detroit to discuss worldwide unemployment and
underemployment.  I would like to ask the Prime Minister whether
his ministers are taking any specific proposals for job creation
at all to that meeting and particularly whether the private
sector's views on job creation have been included and are going
to be presented. 

Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister): Mr. Speaker,
that is certainly what the Minister of Finance and the other
ministers will do. 

We said that 85 per cent of the jobs in Canada will be created
by small and medium size businesses in the future.  That is why
we have passed some legislation and made some adjustments that
will induce the private sector to create these jobs. 

They will explain the technique Canada has decided to use.  I
hope that others will benefit from our views. 

If in the course of the discussions someone were to come up with
the miracle solution, of course we would take it, but it is
a complicated situation all over the world. 

We know Canada has a problem.  Some will say perhaps we should
reduce or abandon the minimum wage.  Canada is not that kind of a
country.  Canada does not want to have sweatshops in order for
people to have jobs.  We are a civilized nation that wants to do
it the proper way.  We have a good regime, but if somebody has a
better idea then we are open to it. 

I am a Liberal.  I am not a doctrinaire person.  I borrow from
the left and I borrow from the right, as long as the solution is
right. 

[Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):  Mr. Speaker, we
appreciate the Prime Minister's answer and we certainly recognize
that the Prime Minister borrows. 

The Prime Minister made reference and the Minister of Finance is
now admitting that a $1 billion spending cut in UI creates more
jobs than a $1 billion spending increase on infrastructure.  To
be consistent therefore will Canada be recommending tax cuts as a
job creation strategy at the G-7 meeting?
[Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):  Mr. Speaker,
the infrastructure program is a very good program and will create
jobs immediately.  It has been subscribed to enthusiastically by
all provincial governments and all the municipalities, including
the beautiful city of Calgary.  That good program is one part of
our strategy. 

We have reduced some laws passed by the Conservative government
by decreasing the level of unemployment insurance premiums made
by the private sector over the period of two years from $3.30 to
$3.  That will put something like $300 million in the hands of
small businesses. 

However as explained earlier we have to have a balanced approach
and job creation to improve the infrastructure of the nation.  It
is a good program, especially at a time when there is a very high
level of unemployment in one country. 

[Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):  Mr. Speaker,
the Minister of Finance and some members of the government are
beginning to admit that reducing tax loads is the most direct way
to create jobs.  However the Minister of Human Resources
Development and to some extent the Prime Minister continue to
stress increased government spending on things like
infrastructure as the most direct way to create jobs. 

At this meeting are the government ministers singing from the
same song sheet?  Which approach is Canada advocating at the G-7
meetings:  government led job creation through increased
spending, or private sector led job creation through tax cuts? 

[Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):  Mr. Speaker,
both techniques were used in the last budget.
[Translation]
  Collège Militaire de Saint-Jean 



Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): Mr. Speaker, a crowd of 3,000 
demonstrated yesterday in Saint-Jean against the federal government's 
decision to close the only francophone military college in Canada. In a 
complete about-turn on this issue, the Quebec Premier now says that the 
Collège militaire de Saint-Jean must continue to exist and its military 
orientation maintained. 

My question is for the right honourable Prime Minister. 
Will the Prime Minister confirm that his government is presently 
negotiating with the Quebec government to ensure that certain military 
training activities are maintained at the Collège militaire de Saint-Jean?   

Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister): Mr. Speaker, we are 
discussing at this time with the government of Quebec and, if this 
college can be used as an institution of higher learning in the province 
of Quebec, we will be more than happy to work together with the 
government of Quebec. No decisions have been made.  As far as we 
are concerned, with closures across the country, we want to try and find 
ways of helping the cities and municipalities affected in order to 
minimize the impact. 

[Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): Mr. Speaker, are we to understand 
that the Prime Minister rejects the plea of the Quebec Premier who views  
keeping Saint-Jean in operation as a golden opportunity to give real 
substance to the Canadian linguistic duality.  

[Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister): Mr. Speaker, as I 
watched images of the demonstration yesterday, it occurred to me that 
many of the people protesting were the same people who, in 1970 or 1971 
if I am not mistaken, were demonstrating against the Collège militaire 
de Saint-Jean obtaining university status or offering university 
certification. There were lengthy negotiations. The University of 
Montreal refused under pressure, and so did the University of Quebec. 
Finally and fortunately, the University of Sherbrooke accepted. The 
nationalists demonstrating yesterday were the same ones who 20 years ago 
did not want the Saint-Jean military college to exist for francophones 
in Quebec.

 Science and Technology 



Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan--Similkameen--Merritt):  Mr.
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 

It is recognized that science has an enormous contribution to
make to the creation of new jobs for the new economy.  Yet there
has been very little reference to the role of science from the
government. 

Does the government have a science policy?  If so, could the
Prime Minister tell us in a nutshell what this policy is? 

Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):  Mr. Speaker,
the hon. member does not need a nutshell; he can read the budget.
In fact we decided to increase the contribution to science in
Canada in the last budget.  The hon. member should read the red
book where it says that investment in research and development is
needed to have Canada in a good position to compete
internationally in the 21st century.
[Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan--Similkameen--Merritt):   I have a
supplementary question, Mr. Speaker. 

The previous government tried to set targets for total research
and development spending in Canada in the vicinity of 2 per cent
to 3 per cent of GDP.  Could the Prime Minister tell the House
the targets for R and D spending in Canada and specifically for
departments and agencies of his government? 

[Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):   Mr. Speaker,
if the hon. member reads the budget he will find that. 

I am happy when I see a member of the Reform Party standing up
after four months to ask the government to spend more money.  It
is very refreshing to hear that.  We hear that every day.  Now
the reality is hitting them.  So much the better.
[Translation]
 Youth Employment 



Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier--Sainte-Marie):  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.  Nearly 20 per cent of young 
Quebecers and Canadians are unemployed today--an unacceptable record of 
428,000 people under 25.  In the Speech from the Throne, the government 
announced that it wants to better prepare young people to enter the 
labour market. 

Does the Prime Minister admit that his youth apprenticeship program 
in no way meets the needs of Quebec since Quebec got only $2 million out 
of a total budget of $225 million in 1993 under this program, or less 
than 1 per cent of the money spent? 

Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):  Mr. Speaker, if the 
situation was that bad under the former government, we intend to rectify 
it.  It is this government's policy to ensure that Quebec is not treated 
worse than the other provinces. 

[Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier--Sainte-Marie):  Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary question is again for the Prime Minister.  The reason that 
Quebec gets less is that vocational training and the education system do 
not include apprenticeship courses or programs as they exist in the rest 
of Canada.  Quebec has a different system. 

Given the failures of this program, can the Prime Minister promise 
to give Quebec its fair share of the funds allocated under this program 
so that Quebec can use them more effectively, according to its own 
priorities? 

[Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):  Mr. Speaker, that is 
exactly what we are trying to do now.  That is why the Minister of Human 
Resources Development is having discussions with his provincial 
counterpart to find an arrangement whereby Quebec can receive its fair 
share and use it effectively so that young Quebecers, like other young 
Canadians, are as well prepared as possible to enter the labour market, 
because it will be very difficult for them as well as for others.   

We must work co-operatively to ensure that all young Canadians are 
sufficiently well prepared that we can occupy our rightful place in the 
very competitive world which we will have to face in the coming years.
[English]
   Aboriginal Self-Government 



Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):   Mr. Speaker, my question
is for the Prime Minister. 

The government has committed itself to establishing aboriginal
self-government in the province of Manitoba.  Last week neither
the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development nor the
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs was able to provide the
House with a clear straightforward definition of aboriginal
self-government. 

Will the Prime Minister, as head of the government and as a
former minister of Indian affairs, please give the House his
definition of aboriginal self-government, particularly as it
relates to Manitoba? 

Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):   Mr. Speaker,
I will take the question but I know that my minister for
federal-provincial relations gave the answer last week. 

When we negotiate with a group of people about what should be
the status of running their own affairs, we cannot give the final
decision before it has been negotiated. 

What are the goals of the government?  They are not very
complicated.  I was Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern
Affairs Development for more than six years.  I know that we need
a different regime where we can delegate to them the authority to
make their own decisions. 
I have said time and again that we made a lot of mistakes.
Perhaps the time has come to let them make some mistakes
themselves by giving them the authority to decide locally
regarding education, welfare, housing, economic development and
not have them wait for instructions from bureaucrats in Ottawa.
[Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):   Mr. Speaker, as a
supplementary question, will the federal government after having
arrived at this definition in some way then allow the aboriginal
peoples and all the peoples in Manitoba to voice their approval
or disapproval of the example through a system of referendum? 

[Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):  Mr. Speaker,
every member of the House has been elected to make decisions.
There will be a vote in the House of Commons.  I do not believe
that every time we have a difficult problem in Canada we wash our
hands of it by having a referendum.  That is not my way. 

Tough decisions have to be made by government.  If we do not
make the right decisions it is up to the electors to tell us in
the next election.  It is democracy that is best.  It is
complicated enough in that area.  If we let a huge majority
decide in a complicated situation like this where there are some
tensions between different races, it is not a good way to solve
it.  The best way is for every one of us to take our own
responsibility, vote in the House of Commons and live with the
judgment we have expressed on behalf of our electors in the
House.
[Translation]
 Publishing Industry 



Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville--Deux-Montagnes): Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. The takeover of Ginn Publishing by 
the American company Paramount continues to arouse controversy. In the 
meantime, the government persists in concealing the identity of the 
person who made the verbal commitment allowing this transaction to take 
place. 

Under his great transparency policy, does the Prime Minister not 
find it disturbing and even unhealthy that Parliament cannot know the 
identity of the person behind the verbal commitment that derailed the 
established policy on ownership of Canadian cultural industries? 
Who is the government protecting in this affair? 

[English]
Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International
Financial Institutions)):   Mr. Speaker, there was a very
complete statement given on the Gin question by the Parliamentary
Secretary to the Minister of Finance.  The member will find it on
page 1838 of Hansard.  To summarize, we had a legal
responsibility to enter into this contract and it was done. It
was left to us by the previous government. 

What our government did was get a better deal.  It improved the
deal by putting in Canadian content requirements, author
requirements and distribution requirements.  It was a great deal
for Canada. 

[Translation]
[Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville--Deux-Montagnes): Mr. Speaker, I 
would have thought that a transparent policy means not having anything 
to hide and answering the questions that are asked. We asked for a name. 
We did not get it.  

The Minister of Canadian Heritage is trying to hide his abdication 
of responsibility in this affair behind the changes to the Baie-Comeau 
policy made by the Tories in 1992. To avoid repeating that mess, can the 
Prime Minister make a commitment today to fully restore the provisions 
of the Baie-Comeau policy protecting Canadian ownership of cultural 
industries? 

[English]
[Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International
Financial Institutions)):  Mr. Speaker, the question that has
been raised is interesting.  The decision was made in 1989 when
the leader of the Bloc Quebecois was in the cabinet.  Maybe he
has some special information on the deal that he would like to
share with the House.  That was when the situation arose and that
was the responsibility of the previous government.  If the member
is looking for responsibility, look right in the front row of
your own party.
 

    Rail Line Abandonment 



Mr. Murray Calder (Wellington--Grey--Dufferin--Simcoe):
Mr. Speaker, I wish to direct my question to the Minister of
Transport. 

There are currently a number of rail lines or subdivisions in
the province of Ontario undergoing an abandonment procedure
through the National Transportation Agency.  In my riding,
Wellington--Grey--Dufferin--Simcoe, the NTA is to rule on the
abandonment of the Meaford subdivision which runs from Barry to
Collingwood.  There are prospective buyers interested in
purchasing the line but they are hesitant as a result of the
Ontario labour legislation known as Bill 40. 

What proactive steps has the Minister of Transport taken with
the Ontario government to ensure that rail lines are not torn out
of the ground before this critical issue is resolved in order to
ensure a solid and diversified transportation infrastructure? 

Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):  Mr. Speaker,
I want to be very clear in my answer to my colleague with respect
to any proactive steps we might take with the Government of
Ontario.  We obviously have to respect the jurisdiction of the
Government of Ontario in this matter.  However I would like to
tell my friend that there were a number of companies indicating
interest for short line operations in the province of Ontario as
well as other parts of the country based on a couple of
reasonably good experiences that we have had in Canada with that
type of operation. 

I think it would be fair to say that since that legislation was
brought forward and passed at Queen's Park that interest has
diminished very significantly.  It is unfortunate because there
will be undoubtedly many opportunities for short line operators
to take over rail lines in various parts of Canada.  It is sad
that they are not going to have an opportunity, I do not believe,
to do it with the same kind of facility in Ontario as would have
been the case had this legislation not been passed.
    Vancouver Port Authority 



Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena): Mr. Speaker, my question is for
the Minister of Transport. 

The Vancouver Port Authority recently approved a Las Vegas style
casino project even though such for profit casinos are not legal
in British Columbia.  Could the minister explain why a federal
authority is approving tenders for activities that are currently
illegal in British Columbia? 

Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):  Mr. Speaker,
obviously the proposal that has been taken under consideration by
the Vancouver Port Authority is not one that would allow through
any measures that authority could undertake for illegal activity.

I do want to answer my friend by saying that one of the policies
that we are following in this government, not only with respect
to ports but also obviously as we move toward devolution of
control for airports, will be to allow for local autonomy.  One
cannot have it both ways.  I am sure that the people on the
ground in the greater Vancouver area who have the direct
responsibility for management of that area, both the real estate
as well as the port, will take into account the best interest not
only of that region but of the province of British Columbia and
certainly would not be prepared to act in any way that would be
contrary to the law. 

[Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena):  Mr. Speaker, I thank the
minister for his answer.  I have a supplementary question. 

This project has caused much concern among the people of British
Columbia.  The federal government clearly has no mandate to
develop casino gambling across Canada. 

Could the minister explain to the concerned citizens of British
Columbia and indeed all Canadians, given the complete absence of
public consultation, how and why the federal government decided
to approve this casino project? 

[Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):  Mr. Speaker,
first let me clear up a statement that was made by the member
that I am sure he did not intend to mislead the House with and
that is that the Government of Canada does not approve that
particular situation.  There is a local board that is autonomous
and is appointed.  It is made up of a number of representatives
chosen in a very broad selection process. 

The question of what will happen with that land, in my view, is
far from determined finally because the Government of British
Columbia will have a great deal to say about that.  As he says,
the law does not permit casino activities at this point.  I think
it is an opportunity for residents of the area to review the
matter and make their views known to the Government of Canada, to
the Government of British Columbia and obviously to the port
authority. 

However, there is certainly no final decision on this.  I
understand the preoccupation of the member as well as many of the
people in British Columbia with respect to this particular
proposal.

 Cable Broadcasting Industry 



Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne): Mr. Speaker, before I put my 
question, I would like to say that there should be and there can be 
transparency when people are aware of current political affairs.  This 
is not always obvious to the other side.
My question is for the Prime Minister.  Rogers Communications is 
poised to take over the Maclean Hunter Group.  This blockbuster 
transaction will create a virtual monopoly in the cable broadcasting 
industry, a situation which raises some important questions as to the 
level of competition within this industry. 

My question is this:  Does the Prime Minister recognize that this 
takeover will create a monopoly in the field of cable broadcasting and 
that this situation will adversely affect rates and the variety of 
information available to consumers? 

Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister): Mr. Speaker, I believe 
that before any approval is given, a submission must be made to CRTC 
commissioners.  I am not in a position to comment on a ruling by this 
commission before public hearings are held. 

[Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne): Mr. Speaker, I believe we are 
here to get some answers. 

Does the Prime Minister not recognize that this monopoly in the 
cable broadcasting industry and Rogers' 32-per-cent ownership of Unitel 
shares give this company an unfair advantage over its cable and 
telephone industry competitors in terms of the development of the 
information highway? 

Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):  Mr. Speaker, this 
matter does not come under ministerial jurisdiction at this time.  The 
Parliament of Canada established a wholly independent commission to rule 
on acquisitions of this nature in such areas.  The only power we have, 
and it is quite limited considering Parliament's wish that decisions be 
made by people outside the executive, is to wait and see what the 
Commission's ruling on this matter will be.  It is not that we do not 
want to answer the question, it is that we are not in a position to 
supply you with an answer.

    Cross-Border Shopping 



Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar--Marquette):  Mr. Speaker, my
question is for the Minister of National Revenue. 

The government has extended the hours of several Canada customs
ports of entry in Manitoba.  Smugglers know to stay away from
these ports, but more Manitobans are being encouraged to go south
of the border to take advantage of cheap food, liquor and
gasoline. 

Is the minister aware that the only impact of his actions are
Canadian dollars going south and this is hurting Manitoba
business people, not smugglers? 

Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):  Mr.
Speaker, the extra customs activities at the border are having an
effect on smugglers and are beneficial from that point of view. 

I do not agree with the hon. member's contention that it is the
job of national revenue to make it difficult for Canadians to
cross the border, whether they live in Manitoba or in any other
place.  If Canadians are finding extended hours useful for them
in their activities I think that it is something Canada customs
would regard as a side benefit from the attempts they are making
to curb smuggling. 

[Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar--Marquette):  Mr. Speaker, I
appreciate that answer. 

I would like to point out to the hon. minister that on February
25 Manitoba RCMP arrested two men for smuggling $28,000 worth of
liquor and tobacco.  The truck had been driven across the border
at a point not controlled by Canada customs and was stopped at
Elie, approximately 100 miles from the border. 

Would the minister consider making one of those tough decisions,
close these border points at night and transfer the funds to
extra RCMP supervision of these border crossings? 

[Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue): Mr.
Speaker, among the many measures that were announced with respect
to smuggling was the beefing up of patrols by the RCMP. There
will be more RCMP officers involved in this than there will be
customs officers.  This was announced by the Prime Minister, the
Solicitor General and myself some weeks ago. 

Certainly we do not expect to pick up all smuggled shipments at
the border.  We do expect to pick them up either in Canada or
sometimes in the United States prior to reaching the border, as
happened with a large number of semi-automatic weapons quite
recently. 

I congratulate the member for pointing out the efficiency of the
RCMP and the customs service in picking up smuggled goods, but I
would point out to him that we do not rely only on the physical
proximity to the border to make such seizures.
 

     Canadian Wheat Board 



Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Dauphin--Swan River):  Mr. Speaker,
my question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. 

Our red book platform promise was to maintain the Canadian Wheat
Board.  There are some groups on the prairies, particularly one
identifying itself as the alliance which is promoting the idea of
a farmer plebiscite on the removal of barley from the sole
jurisdiction of the Canadian Wheat Board. 

I would ask the minister of agriculture if he has considered the
possibility of consulting the farm community about strengthening
the power of the board by bringing oats back on to the board and
by expanding its jurisdiction to the international market. 

Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and
Agri-Food):  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for
her question and for her interest in the Canadian Wheat Board. 

This question and others that have been asked reflect the
diversity of opinion in western Canada with respect to the
operations and the jurisdiction of the wheat board.  I continue
to have a great many consultations and discussions with the board
and with others, particularly with farmers, about the board's
operations and its future direction. 

With respect to the matter of a plebiscite, there are many
differing views on the question.  Indeed some who had argued
against a plebiscite a year ago are now arguing in favour of one
and vice versa. 

In considering the government's position we will keep the hon.
member's representations in mind.  My objective, and it is the
objective of the government, is to obtain the very best possible
marketing results for farmers both now and in the long term. 
Every action of the government will be very much aimed in that
direction.

 Official Residences 



Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois--Salaberry): Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Public Works. Last February 16, the 
Minister of Public Works was not able to tell the opposition what 
amounts will be spent for the renovation of the official residences of 
the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Speaker of the 
House, as well as the summer cottage of the Prime Minister at Harrington 
Lake. 

Since the question was asked a month ago already, is the Minister 
of Public Works in a position now to tell us about the scope of these 
renovations, or is he still too uncomfortable to justify such spending 
in times of budget austerity and salary freeze? 

[English]
Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and Government
Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities
Agency):  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows quite well that
the minister responsible for Canadian heritage whose jurisdiction
this matter falls within is away on government business. 

I will endeavour to ascertain the information requested.  I am
certain I can report back to the House and to the hon. member
with the specific information requested. 

[Translation]
[Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois--Salaberry): Mr. Speaker, I will 
ask my supplementary to the Prime Minister, because there does not seem 
to be a great deal of communication between him and his minister. Why 
does the Prime Minister not intervene regarding the money spent on these 
residences, particularly Stornoway, the residence of the Leader of the 
Opposition, which is not even being lived in?  

[Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister): Mr. Speaker, I cannot 
speak on behalf of the commission responsible for these official 
residences. However, I can tell you that, as regards the residence of 
the Prime Minister as well as his summer cottage, no renovation of any 
kind will be made, as everyone knows. I did not buy furniture; instead, 
I used what was available, in order to limit spending as much as 
possible. As far as I know, no major renovations are to take place.  

It may be that a plumber will have to do some work, but I am not 
going to throw him out! However, nothing major is scheduled for 24 
Sussex, nor for the residence at Harrington Lake. There could always be 
some technical problem. Unfortunately, I had to answer so many questions 
today that I did not have time to study my book on how to solve these 
technical problems.

     Human Rights 



Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton--Melville):  Mr. Speaker, my
question is for the Minister of Justice. 

On January 27 the minister announced in the House the
government's intention to introduce amendments to the Human
Rights Act which ``will include sexual orientation as a ground
upon which discrimination is prohibited''. 

Could the minister tell the House what is the government's
definition of sexual orientation?
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of
Canada):  Mr. Speaker, that provision is now in the human
rights codes or statutes of seven of the ten provinces. It has
also been broadly dealt with in the jurisprudence as cases have
come before the courts and tribunals with respect to the rights
of individuals. 

I think that in Canadian law there is no question about the
meaning of that term in statutes such as the Canadian Human
Rights Act.  I commend the decisions of the courts to my friend,
the hon. member, if there is any doubt in his mind. 

[Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton--Melville):  Mr. Speaker,
my supplementary question is for the Minister of Justice. 

Will the minister include a definition of sexual orientation in
the legislation he proposes, and will this definition be clear
enough to prevent pedophiles from launching successful court
challenges of discrimination for acts that are clearly prohibited
in the Criminal Code? 

[Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of
Canada):  Mr. Speaker, in matters involving the law, as in so
much else in life, we are governed by that which is reasonable.
If I may say so, I do not believe it is reasonable for anybody to
interpret the term sexual orientation as it appears in human
rights legislation as including pedophiles or others who engage
in criminal conduct. 

As I mentioned in my response to the hon. member's first
question, it is my belief that judgments of courts and tribunals
across the country interpreting legislation that is already on
the books in many provinces makes the meaning of that term
abundantly clear.  We have no intention to make that additional
provision in the proposed amendments.

 Allan Memorial Institute 



Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse): Mr. Speaker, my question is 
directed to the Minister of Justice.   

During the last election campaign, the Liberal Party of Canada 
promised to compensate the families of victims of the brainwashing 
experiments using electroshock therapy and drugs, conducted at the Allen 
Memorial Institute in Montreal in the fifties and sixties, but the 
Minister of Justice has just refused to compensate these families.  

Could the Minister tell us whether he intends to follow up on his 
party's promise of financial assistance or are we to understand that the 
government has reversed its position?  

[English]
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of
Canada):  Mr. Speaker, the role of the Department of Justice
in the program that was instituted to compensate those who were
victimized by the program in question is to assess each
application in terms of the provisions of the order in council
which created the fund and to determine whether the applicants
meet the criteria established by that legislation. 

That is precisely what we have done.  In each case, many of
which have come to my notice by way of applications for review,
we have carefully matched the circumstances of the applicant with
the parameters of the order in council.  I am satisfied that in
each such case we have followed the law to its letter.
      The Budget 



Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):  Mr. Speaker, my
question is for the Prime Minister and was inspired by Annie du
la Chevrotiere of Brackendale, British Columbia. 

Recently the Minister of Finance stated that his ultimate goal
is to eliminate the deficit and balance the national budget.  If
the Prime Minister agrees with his Minister of Finance, will he
commit to making a balanced federal budget a requirement of law? 

Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):  Mr. Speaker,
as the sound of the name is French perhaps I should reply in
French because it is not the hon. member's question but was
apparently asked by somebody else. 

Every government wants to balance its books.  No government
wants a deficit.  We have a target that is very well established
in the red book to reduce the deficit in relation to GNP to 3 per
cent and we intend to do that.  Of course when we get to 3 per
cent we will try to go lower and the day we have a balanced
budget I will be extremely happy.  But I cannot guarantee that to
anybody. 

Even if we were to pass that law, sometimes things happen which
are completely outside the control of government and we have to
meet those needs.  It is a kind of dream to think that passing a
law will balance the books.  They have done it in the United
States for how many years? They still have a problem there too.
It is a problem around the world. 

In Canada we have the problem but it is no worse than the one in
Europe.  Our deficit in relation to GNP is 6.2 per cent and the
average in Europe is 6.5 per cent. 
I am not happy with that.  I want to reduce it to 3 per cent in
the next three years.  After that we will go lower with
everybody's help.


 Social programs 



Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound--Muskoka):   Mr. Speaker, a
recent poll shows that Canadians support the government's
initiative to reform social programs.  Yet some individuals have
expressed concern that the government's objective may be solely
to cut services and programs. 

What assurances can the parliamentary secretary to the human
resources minister give the House that indeed the government's
prime objective is to provide Canadians with better, more
efficient services? 

Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister
of Human Resources Development):   Mr. Speaker, I can assure
the hon. member and Canadians that we have no intention of
cutting services for the Canadian people.  We are working with
the provincial governments to bring about more efficient delivery
of services. 

The single window initiative will improve service to clients,
will eliminate duplication and waste and will increase
administrative efficiencies.  As a matter of fact last week we
opened a new employment resource centre in Ottawa that will merge
the two services. 

We plan to give Canadians only the very best.

 Commonwealth Day 



Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): Mr.
Speaker, today is Commonwealth Day, celebrated annually on the
second Monday in March to mark the establishment of the modern
Commonwealth. 

Each year a special theme is attached to this day.  The focus
this year is on sports and the Commonwealth.  This theme has
special significance for Canada because we will be hosting the
15th Commonwealth Games this summer in Victoria, British
Columbia.  For an unprecedented fourth time in the history of the
Commonwealth Games, Canada will have the honour of hosting the
Commonwealth's festival of sports and culture. 

The Commonwealth exemplifies unity and diversity and the
strength of multilateralism and co-operation.  Almost one-quarter
of the world's population now forms the Commonwealth. 

Through the Commonwealth, Canada is linked with 49 other
countries of various races, faiths, languages, cultures and
traditions.  The Commonwealth provides an opportunity for Canada
to enhance its relationships with the member countries and to
advance Canadian foreign policy interests. 

Canadians can take pride in the accomplishments of the
Commonwealth to which Canada has contributed greatly over its
long and vital history.  Arnold Smith, a remarkable Canadian
diplomat and the first Secretary General of the Commonwealth who
unfortunately died last month, is just one example of the
dedicated Canadians who have helped to build the Commonwealth and
its institutions.  Canada will continue to contribute to the
Commonwealth through the 1990s and beyond. 

In just over one month Canadian observers will be present
alongside other Commonwealth and international observers for the
first ever democratic elections in South Africa.  These elections
are an important step in that country's history. 

After having assumed a leadership role within the Commonwealth
and the fight against apartheid and for universal suffrage these
elections also hold a very special significance for Canada and
Canadians. Our efforts in the aftermath of these elections will
not diminish.
I assure hon. members and Canadians that we will continue to be
a prominent member of the Commonwealth to mobilize efforts to
promote fundamental human values.  These basic values lie at the
heart of the Commonwealth and were reaffirmed in the landmark
1991 Harare declaration. 

The people to people linkages holding the Commonwealth family
together are numerous and are found in every sector and we will
continue to promote them. It is in this spirit that we intend to
host the Commonwealth Games this year. 

I ask all members to join with me today in recognizing the
importance of Canada's membership in the modern Commonwealth. 

[Translation]
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier--Sainte-Marie): Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for the Bloc Quebecois to join the government today in 
recognizing the importance of Canada's membership in the Commonwealth.  
As you know, the Bloc Quebecois remains vigilant to ensure that 
resources allocated by the federal government to the francophonie 
reflect its importance in Canada and correspond to the priorities 
established by Quebec and the francophonie as a whole.  

That being said, we have no intention of neglecting Canada's 
relations with the Commonwealth. 
As the Leader of the Opposition has said before, the Commonwealth is a 
very important forum for Canada to maintain close ties with nearly 50 
countries throughout the world and to encourage the exercise of the 
rights and values cherished by Canada and Quebec.  

On Commonwealth Day, I think it is important to recall that a 
sovereign Quebec would wish to maintain those ties.  Without taking on 
additional financial burdens, Quebec would be able to maintain and 
intensify its relations with countries in the Caribbean, Asia and 
Africa.  A sovereign Quebec will want to be more open to the world, and 
I think this should give you a clear indication of what its position 
will be. 

The Bloc Quebecois is pleased to celebrate this commemorative 
occasion under the special theme: ``Sport and the Commonwealth''.  
And we are certain that Canada will be the perfect host this summer at 
the Fifteenth Commonwealth Games in Victoria.  

[English]
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):   Mr. Speaker, on this
Commonwealth Day we should take a moment to think of the
advantages to Canada of being a member of the modern
Commonwealth. 

As the minister said, it certainly gives us an opportunity to
enhance our position in the world as a potential leader of
one-quarter of the world's population.  It gives us a chance to
demonstrate our expertise, technology and service to a major
world trading bloc.  It also gives us the opportunity to do
something independent of the United States.  That has its
benefits for our national unity as well. 

It is particularly meaningful this year that the Commonwealth
Games will be held in Victoria.  By allowing us to host this
unique event, through the competitiveness of athletics we can
understand our strengths and weaknesses.  We can take this
opportunity to understand the customs, traditions and the ways of
thinking of other people in the Commonwealth. 

The Olympics has given us a great world hope for the future and
has created an environment for potential greater unity.  I am
sure the Commonwealth Games will be an extension of this
goodwill.  Our Victoria friends will do the very best job of
hosting them. I think back to when Edmonton hosted this event and
the great associations and friendships made during that occasion.

I was also interested in the minister's comments on our
commitment to South Africa.  I am concerned about South Africa as
well and the democracy taking place there.  Before we commit
ourselves to what I understand could be in the neighbourhood of
50 people, we must ask what the cost will be, what will actually
be done and what actual value there is to Canadians. 
I was personally asked to get involved in this process.  I must
admit I have great difficulty doing so unless I can have those
three questions answered during these difficult economic times.
We in the Reform Party recognize the importance of Canada's
membership in the modern Commonwealth and we continue to support
that membership.
 Ombudsman Act 



  Bill C-221.  Motions for introduction and first reading
deemed adopted 

Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean) moved for leave to introduce
Bill C-221, an act establishing the office of ombudsman and
amending acts in consequence thereof. 

She said:  Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this act is to establish
the institution of a federal ombudsman.  This would be an
independent and non-partisan officer of this Parliament who would
supervise the administration, deal with specific complaints from
the public against the administrative injustice and the
maladministration and who would have the power to investigate,
criticize and publicize but not to reverse administrative action.

A federal ombudsman with his or her wide powers of
investigation, which is something we as MPs do not have, would be
able to handle the flow of complaints for which parliamentary
procedure is less suitable and to strengthen the present system
at its weak point. 

Furthermore, a federal ombudsman would be the servant of
Parliament and answerable to it alone.

   Excise Tax Act 



  Bill C-222.  Motions for introduction and first reading
deemed adopted 

Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean) moved for leave to introduce
Bill C-222, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act (extremity pumps).

She said:  Mr. Speaker, some people for health reasons require a
piece of medical equipment called an extremity pump.  It is the
supply of an extremity pump that releases swelling caused by
lymphedema of the legs in particular. 

I am simply asking that the Excise Tax Act be amended to allow
for this extremity pump.

 Income Tax Act 



  Bill C-223.  Motions for introduction and first reading
deemed adopted 

Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean) moved for leave to introduce
Bill C-223, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (air
conditioners). 

She said:  Mr. Speaker, the purpose of Bill C-223, which is an
act to amend the Income Tax Act, concerns the cost of an air
conditioner required for health reasons.  To be more specific,
people who suffer from multiple sclerosis find it very difficult
to breathe during the hot humid summer months and would like an
air conditioner.  As it would be used for health purposes, its
cost would be included as a medical expense under the medical
expense tax credit under the Income Tax Act.

  Abortion 



Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of
Foreign Affairs):  Mr. Speaker, it is my duty, pursuant to
Standing Order 36, to present a petition signed by residents of
the greater Toronto region. 

The petition states the response to petition 343-2034 avoided
the thrust of the petition, namely the rights of individuals
under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the individual and
dealing with abortion and Bill C-43.  The Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms applies to the Parliament and Government of
Canada and article 15(1) states: ``Every individual is equal
before and under the law and has the right to equal protection
and equal benefit of the law''. 

The petitioners pray and call upon Parliament to urge the
government to prepare a response to this petition which addresses
why ``individuals within the bodies of their mothers'' are not
individuals with rights under the charter for Parliament to
honour. 

The petitioners urge the government to honour Parliament's
obligation under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and
provide equality before and under the law and equal protection
and equal benefit of law for individuals within the bodies of
their mothers from fertilization to the end of the birthing
process.  In duty bound, the petitioners will ever pray. 

  Canada Post 



Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria--Haliburton):  Mr. Speaker,
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased and honoured to
present a petition signed by a number of constituents from
Victoria--Haliburton, duly certified by the Clerk of Petitions. 

The petition signed by many seniors who live in and around the
Diplomat apartment building in Lindsay, Ontario, request that a
mailbox be located near the residence to provide them with better
access to Canada Post services. 

The petition was circulated by Mrs. Jean Birchard, a resident of
the apartment building, and calls on Parliament to consider
locating a mailbox in the vicinity of 53 Adelaide Street North
for the convenience of the residents of this building and the
surrounding residential district. 

 Killer Cards 



Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North):  Mr. Speaker, I have
two more petitions to present pursuant to Standing Order 36
requesting amendment to the laws regarding killer cards. 

I am aware of the difficulties and the possible restriction on
the freedom of expression with these petitions, but I believe
that because the victims of these crimes are often women and
children and these killer cards are in effect glorifying violence
against women and children I must support these petitions.
       Questions on the Order Paper 

(Questions answered orally are indicated by an asterisk.) 



Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the
Government in the House of Commons):  Mr. Speaker, Question
No. Q-2 will be answered today. 



Question No. 2--Mr. Taylor:



Who was asked to conduct a review of Canada
Post's rural conversion plans, what resources were provided 
for the review process and what criteria and direction was 
given to those asked to conduct the review?



Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency): 
For many years, the government has heard from concerned Canadians 
across the country in regard to the closure of rural post offices and, 
as a result, made the commitment to review the conversion program put 
forward by Canada Post Corporation.

On November 12, 1993, the government declared a moratorium on the 
closure of corporate operated rural post offices.

The moratorium, initially set for a period of one month, was extended 
indefinitely to allow for a comprehensive assessment. During that 
period, consultations were held with Canada Post, labour leaders and 
various community groups.

As a result, on February 17, the government placed an indefinite 
moratorium on future closures of all rural and small town post offices 
in Canada. 

The Deputy Speaker: The question as enumerated by the
parliamentary secretary has been answered. 

Mr. Milliken:  Mr. Speaker, I would ask that all remaining
questions be allowed to stand. 

The Deputy Speaker: Shall the remaining questions stand? 

Some hon. members:  Agreed.
The Deputy Speaker:  I wish to inform the House that,
pursuant to Standing Order 33(2)(b), because of the ministerial
statement and replies, Government Orders will be extended by
eight minutes.

      Allotted Day--The Budget 



  Consideration resumed of motion 

The House resumed consideration of the motion. 

Mr. Morrison:  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.
Immediately prior to members' statements we had a speech from the
hon. Minister of Public Works and Government Services.  It was
very eloquent although somewhat inflammatory. 

I believe that there is still time remaining on the clock and I
am wondering if comments on that matter are possible. 

The Deputy Speaker:  That is an excellent question from
the hon. member.  The procedural expert advises me that if the
minister who made the statement is not here, a member who wishes
to reply may not do so. 

Another time perhaps the hon. member would persuade the minister
to come back.  However, that was a very good procedural effort. 

Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):  Mr. Speaker, I
believe there are two related fundamental questions which must be
considered when considering the motion before the House today.
First, can Canadians continue to live on borrowed money?  Second,
should Canadians continue to live on borrowed money? 

We ought to acknowledge that it is very pleasant to live on
borrowed money.  Certainly Canada has enjoyed that position for
over 20 years now and it is even desirable if only immediate
benefits are the consideration. 

However, I believe that living on borrowed money for our country
amounts to short term gain and a lot of long term paying.
Addressing the question of whether Canada can continue to live on
borrowed money, the answer obviously has to be no, not in the
long term. 

We are already starting to drain away money that would otherwise
have been available to fund our health care education and pension
programs by the interest obligation that we have built up on the
half trillion dollars plus that we have managed to borrow in the
last 20 years. 

Our interest obligation is this year $41 billion.  We are
borrowing only $39.7 billion.  Therefore we are not even
borrowing enough this year to cover our interest payment.  We are
going to have to take away tax dollars that could have gone to
fund social programs if we had not built up in the last 20 years
this interest obligation. 

This means also that for 21 years plus our creditors have funded
an artificially high standard of living for our country.  I would
submit that anyone who lives on an artificially high standard of
living for very long is going to have face reality one day.  That
includes our country. 

Unfortunately the government says that it intends to put us even
further in the hole over the next three years by borrowing
another $100 billion more than we earn.  Even if interest rates
were so fortunate as to stay at around 5 per cent, on the $100
billion the government is going to borrow we will have to pay
each and every year forever $5 billion. 

That is a lot of money.  The interest today that we are paying
amounts to $1,200 per second and that is money that could be
helping a lot of Canadians if it were not going down the drain in
interest on high living for the last 20 years. 

Anyone who has ever run a business or managed a household budget
or even the allowance in their piggy bank knows that if one keeps
spending more money than is coming in soon one will find oneself
in trouble. 
That is a simple fact of life.
Unfortunately our leaders seem to be the only ones who act as
though real life truths need not apply to their decisions.  As
more and more of our income is spent each year on interest, we
are going to have less to spend on health care, education and
pensions, let alone on the new programs that governments keep
introducing, 18 in this particular budget. 

Every dollar that has to go to government in taxes to pay this
interest and to pay for government programs is one less dollar
that can be invested to build and create business and job
producing activity. 

This is not a healthy state of affairs.  Sir Roger Douglas, a
former finance minister of New Zealand, stated: ``The only
justification for the government taxing people and then spending
the money for them is if the government can demonstrate some
special skill or knowledge that the average person does not have
in how to spend the money''.  He then said: ``I simply do not
believe that''. 

I think a lot of Canadians would agree that governments in the
past and present have not demonstrated any special skill in
spending our money for us as Canadians. 

Saddest and most disturbing, however, are the consequences of
governments setting this great country on a course of living on
borrowed money.  It makes future taxpayers the ones who get stuck
with the bill.  Sometimes driving down the road one will see a
bumper sticker, quite often on a nice motor home, saying:  ``We
are spending our children's inheritance''.  This is true: in
Canada today we are spending our children's inheritance.  We are
spending their future earnings. 

This reprehensible behaviour amounts to taxation without
representation.  Instead of paying our own way, enfranchised
Canadians today through their elected leaders are literally
spending money that will have to be paid back with interest
obligation by our children and our grandchildren.  We have
heavily mortgaged their future so that today we can have
expensive and comfortable programs. 

We are not justified in spending the birthright of future
generations of Canadians.  I would further submit that we have a
duty to protect the interests of those who have no say in the
burdens that are being placed upon them.  They are the ones who
are going to have to live with our mistakes.  In 20 short years
we are already worse off than if we had not borrowed a nickel. 

The money that we bring in today is now not entirely going to
fund the help that we want to give disadvantaged people of our
society.  Some of it is already starting to go to pay interest.
As that increases more and more of our income and our tax dollars
are going to have to go to interest.  We will have fewer and
fewer dollars to fund important programs like health care and
education and pensions.  Pretty soon those programs are going to
be squeezed out of existence.  They are already being eroded
right across the country. 

We in the House ought to join together and make the sometimes
tough choices needed to secure our children's future.  The motion
before us today makes four modest proposals to take us in that
direction.  First, the motion urges us to say no new programs and,
second, to put spending caps on the discretion of government. 
The Reform Party has proposed a very modest spending cap of only
6 per cent.  There is barely a household or business in the
entire country that has not cut its spending by at least 6 per
cent and, I would venture to say, a good deal more than that in
the majority of cases.  Yet members of the House in both the
Official Opposition and the government parties would not even
support such a minuscule spending cap by the House.  I say that
is to our shame.
The third proposal we have put forward is to require progress
reports on deficit reduction by those responsible for handling
our finances and our fiscal affairs.  That is an accountability
measure which is only prudent in any company or enterprise. 

Last, as leaders, as people who have been entrusted not only
with today's affairs but with the well-being of future Canadians,
we have to put together a plan for corrective action where we
should not be moving further in the direction of living on
borrowed money. 

For the sake of young and unborn Canadians, I appeal to members
of the House today to show the courage and the leadership to
support the motion before us. 

[Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of
Foreign Affairs):   Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for
her arguments which were presented very clearly.  I am a little
shocked that she and her party would want to cut and not invest
in the youth service corps, something which they threw into their
motion. 

My question for the hon. member is: Which is going to cost the
taxpayers of Canada more?  Is it the young people between 18 and
25 who are not in school or not working?  Their self-esteem goes
down. They will probably get hooked on drugs and steal to pay for
the drug habit.  The girls will probably hit the streets as
prostitutes. 

Does the hon. member feel that she will save the taxpayers more
money by driving our young Canadians in that direction, or will
we save Canadians more money by putting these 18 to 25 year old
Canadian students who are probably dropouts, not in school,
cannot get jobs, by involving them nine months in a youth corps
program where they will work on community projects, where they
will learn skills which will build up their self-confidence,
their self-esteem and hopefully at the end of the youth corps
program be able to find a job? 

Which will cost the taxpayers more, her idiotic program of
cutting the youth corps or what we are presenting in the youth
corps? 

Mrs. Ablonczy:  Mr. Speaker, the doom and gloom parade by
the member opposite in his comment would do the Reform Party
proud, I would think. 

I must say I do not think words like idiotic really add a great
deal to the debate.  As leaders of this country we have an
obligation to discover and consider serious issues in a serious
and thoughtful way.  I would appeal to the member opposite,
through you Mr. Speaker, to do that for the sake of Canadians who
are looking to us for leadership. 

In the past 20 years, with a great deal of borrowed money from
our youth, we have put into place, and the government opposite
was responsible for much of this especially in the early days,
program after program after program that was supposed to help
Canadians, young Canadians, increase employment and do all of the
things the government says it is going to do.  All it has done is
add to the burden placed on our young folks. 

I would challenge not only the hon. member who just spoke but
all members of the government to think about what is going to
happen in 20 years.  Are the young people of the country who are
going to be our taxpayers, business people and the people
responsible for our affairs going to stand and say: Good for you
guys, spending this money on a youth corps in 1994? 
Are they going to say boy, did you ever turn our country around,
or are they going to say look where you guys put us, look at the
hole we are in, look at the tax burden that is on us, look at the
irresponsible way you handled our future?  I ask the member to
ask himself that question.
[Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North):   Mr. Speaker,
when reading the opposition motion I came across two sections
which say``with all parties''.  This party has a plan and we want
to get it through with the co-operation of the other parties.  I
hope thon. members on the other side will support our plan. 

I also mention that statements made today in the House sound
very similar to the statement of the former Prime Minister who
said that there would be jobs for Canadians by the year 2000. The
government does not have the time to wait for the year 2000 to
put Canadians back to work.  We have to put Canadians back to
work now. 

This morning in my constituency office I met two young people
who used to be in a position of giving jobs to others.  Now they
are looking for a job.  These people cannot wait until the year
2000 to get a job.  We all know what happened to the previous
Prime Minister. 

Mrs. Ablonczy:  Mr. Speaker, with respect to the first
comment of the hon. member about developing a contingency plan in
consultation with all parties, I would emphasize that this is a
contingency plan for corrective action, if we read the words in
the motion.  We do not consider the present plan put forward by
the government to be the proper plan for Canada for reasons that
I have just expounded on at some length.  However the plan we
need to put together is a corrective plan. 

I would say again that yes, we can spend whatever money is
necessary to put a few people back to work.  Yes, we can do that
and it would be nice for them.  What I would appeal to the House
to do is look at the long term and look at what is best over all.

Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):   Mr. Speaker, I rise in
the House today to speak in support of this motion.  I and my
party believe that if we do not drastically alter our economic
policies Canadians will be facing an economic crisis in this
country equal to or worse than what was experienced in the 1930s.
Many senior Canadians today still remember the famine, financial
hardship and personal despair of those years. 

Today, because of government overspending, ballooning deficits
and accumulated debts of the last 25 years, we could soon be
facing a similar disaster.  Clearly, when one cuts through the
rhetoric, misguided optimism and smoke and mirrors of this recent
budget, it does nothing to set a new direction or chart a new
course for economic healing that we must see if we are to avoid
this looming crisis. 

Therefore we in the Reform Party are presenting some
constructive actions and offering co-operation to the government
in seizing the window of opportunity before it is lost for
another four or five years. 

In the business and non-political community there is general
acceptance that we cannot continue to spend huge sums of money
over and above our income.  Why is it then that the government
accepts with many accolades that we should spend in the next
fiscal year $3 billion more than last year, accept another
deficit of $40 billion and accept $100 billion more debt in the
next three years on top of the outrageous $500 billion we now
carry? 

In modern history where are the examples of countries where
governments with debt loads of 100 per cent of GDP were able to
stimulate economic growth without becoming involved in another
world war?  I submit there are many examples of the consequences
of government overspending and mismanagement which have brought
once prosperous countries to their economic knees.  Sweden and
New Zealand are but two of the most recent examples. 

Speakers and writers from these countries do not like to talk
much about the real devastation and hardship that the economic
restructuring of these economies caused. 
However, if one probes behind the stories of rebirth and of
economic health there are also stories of despair, bankruptcy and
real hardship when there is a major withdrawal of the social
safety net, a devaluation of the currency and a downsizing of the
bureaucracy.
In spite of these examples, as I have listened to the debate
since budget day, I have heard one government member after
another praise the Minister of Finance for presenting a budget
that will solve the economic ills we face today.  They accuse us
of being uncaring, racist and without compassion because they say
our proposals are Draconian and meanspirited. 

The best example of this rhetoric was this morning when we were
accused of abandoning the interests of Canadian youth.  The best
example of the abandonment of the interests of our Canadian youth
has to be the mortgage that we have placed upon the youth of
today, offering as an alternative nine months of community
service cutting grass and cleaning up the highways for students
who worked hard and struggled long hours to achieve university
degrees and high school diplomas.  It is a disgrace. 

I suggest members opposite pull their heads out from the sand
and stop misleading and deceiving Canadians by telling them that
we can solve our current problems with no hardship or sacrifice. 
This might have been true at least to some degree when Mr.
Trudeau defeated Mr. Joe Clark, or even when Mr. Mulroney
defeated Mr. John Turner.  However, today with the debt growing
faster and faster and with debt servicing combined with social
spending consuming 90 per cent of government spending, there is
simply no miracle cure and no easy way out. 

Therefore let us be honest and, in the best interest of all
Canadians, let us work together to inform Canadians about the
seriousness of this problem and then present to them a credible,
rational, well thought out plan to deal with the crisis. 

It is also clear from the debate on the budget that the members
of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition have no grasp of the problem or
any rational solution when they suggest that social spending is
untouchable and if we cut the fat from government operations we
can return to economic health.  Surely they must realize that the
entire cost of government operations amounts to only half of the
current year's deficit. 

I believe that an examination of political history here and
elsewhere would show that it would be in the best interest of
this government to demonstrate some honesty and leadership in
dealing with the deficit.  Clearly if a government is dedicated
to improving Canada's economic health and moving it out of these
tough economic times it will have to make those moves in the
first year of its mandate, if it is to reap the benefits of those
measures at the polls in the next election. 

If those members opposite continue to mislead Canadians with
statements like ``we don't really have a spending problem, we
have an income problem'', they surely will only incur the wrath
of the electorate when they realize the utter incompetence of
such statements. 

I know without a doubt what the consequences would be if I or
any of the members opposite were to go out and purchase with
borrowed money an expensive car, a luxurious home or an opulent
boat and then when the banker presses for payment tell him:  ``I
don't have a spending problem; I have an income problem''.  The
consequences of such an action would be the same as the
consequences for Canada:  bankruptcy and financial collapse. 

In conclusion, I urge these members opposite to remove their
partisan blinkers and for the preservation of our wonderful
country please examine carefully and honestly where we are
heading in this country.  With the same care and honesty, I urge
members to examine this motion and our offer of co-operation
before they cast their votes in the traditional partisan
political fashion. 

[Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough):  Mr. Speaker, I have been
listening with interest to speeches from the other side of the
House today, attacking our efforts to assist the young people of
Canada, giving derogatory descriptions of the youth corps before
it has been possible to put the youth corps in place and see what
can actually be done. 
From what I hear people think it is a make work project, moving
sand and gravel from one place to another; whereas in fact it is
a program designed to help communities and young people to gain
experience which will bridge the difficult transition between
school of various sorts and the workplace.
The member just said that the youth corps program was our only
alternative for these young people.  I wonder where the member
has been in the last 10 years, the years in which the deficit has
grown to these astronomical levels. 

We think in the United States of Mr. Reagan, in Britain of Mrs.
Thatcher and in Canada of Mr. Mulroney with their slash and burn
policies which not only created these huge debts and deficits but
created in each of the jurisdictions serious unemployment
problems, particularly among the youth who are being attacked by
this motion of the Reform Party today. 

What suggestions does the member have other than slash and burn
for helping young people today, next week and the week after? 

Mr. Chatters:  Because we on this side of the House have
yet to receive any details about the youth corps program we can
only judge the merits of the program from similar programs
presented by previous governments.  In my opinion those programs
were dismal in providing meaningful employment to students of our
universities and high schools.  Certainly that has been the
experience. 

Further to the hon. member's comments, the best thing we could
do for our young people is to cut the tax burden and allow
private enterprise to create jobs and get the economic engine of
this country rolling.  Stop trying to do what governments have
been trying to do since time immemorial, that is create
employment through government spending and borrowing money. 

[Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South): Mr. Speaker, the
previous speaker gave some numbers in the House about the Liberal
Party adding another $100 million to the debt over the next three
years.  Other speakers from the Reform have indicated the same
thing as if their financial plan during the campaign would not
have added to the debt.  I wonder why there is this double
standard. 

In his closing statement the hon. member said we have to stop
spending on these kinds of programs for the benefit of all
Canadians.  I wonder if the member might want to consider whether
he talking on behalf of Canadians who have rather than on behalf
of Canadians who have not. 

Mr. Chatters:  Mr. Speaker, I am a Canadian who considers
himself to be a have not.  I am very much a grass roots Canadian.
I speak for those of my social and economic level. 

It would appear to me from what I have heard from the members
opposite that perhaps the government wants us all to be have not
people in our society.  We are not saying that many of the
programs proposed in the budget are not good programs, are not
worthwhile programs, our problem comes when we borrow money and
we increase debt to support those programs. 

If we can afford these programs we should provide them for
Canadians.  At a time when we can no longer afford them we have
to cut back on programs provided for Canadians. 

Mrs. Marlene Catterall (Parliamentary Secretary to President
of the Treasury Board):   Mr. Speaker, may I indicate to the
Chair and to the House that government members speaking on this
motion will be dividing their time for the remainder of the
debate. 

I am pleased to have this opportunity to rise in the House and
address this motion.  On February 22 the Minister of Finance
tabled the government's first budget.  It was a budget based on,
as the minister said at that time, an unprecedented process of
consultation with Canadians. 

What we e as a government have put before the House and before
the Canadian people in our first budget is only a first step. 
It will not solve everything overnight but it will provide a
basis that we can build on.  This is not a simplistic
unidimensional step.  It is the first step to economic recovery,
to the well-being of individual Canadians and to the elimination
of the deficit.
We have listened to Canadians.  We are pursuing our game plan
and it includes jobs and growth.  During the election campaign we
made very clear the solutions we were proposing and we are
following through on these commitments. 

Members opposite would have you believe that they somehow hold
some kind of secret solution.  Yet their only solution is to cut.
This is a scorched earth policy and we feel, frankly, that what
Canadians said on October 25, 1993 was that they were burned
enough by that approach. 

One of the best examples of what can be expected from the
government is a positive, constructive program, the
infrastructure program.  Infrastructure Works is a shared cost
initiative which brings all levels of government together working
on opportunities for Canadians, working on job creation, working
on investing in the very foundation of our economic prosperity
for the future. 

Each level of government, federal, provincial and territorial,
and municipal will contribute $2 billion for a total of $6
billion over the next two years.  This is what Canadians want to
see, governments co-operating to solve our problems, not
governments at each other's throats, competing with each other.
The program is also open to private sector investment in these
public purpose initiatives, if such investment is useful and can
assist local governments. 

A federal share has been allocated to each province and
territory based on a formula melding population and unemployment
shares, a formula I might add that was agreed to by all first
ministers in December.  Each province and territory will match
the federal allocation as will local governments. 

Infrastructure Works is intended to speed the economic recovery
while meeting the well documented needs of renewing and upgrading
Canada's infrastructure.  The program should help municipalities
and communities use new, efficient and environmentally sound
technologies as well as improve our competitiveness and
productivity. 

There has been a dramatic decline in what we have invested in
infrastructure over the last few decades.  In the 1960s the three
levels of government invested 4.3 per cent of gross domestic
product in infrastructure.  This declined in the 1980s to 2.5 per
cent. 

Many members in the House and I have substantial municipal
experience.  We know from experience that a road not repaired and
maintained today means one spends 10 times as much when that road
falls apart.  We know that allowing bridges to rust and collapse
means a much bigger burden for the next generation than the cost
of repairing that infrastructure today.  We know that unhealthy
water systems in our communities are neither in the best
interests of this generation or the next, nor is it responsible
of us to leave that burden to the next generation. 

We have just started to renew the Great Lakes clean-up agreement
with the province of Ontario.  The province has stressed to us
and the International Joint Commission has stressed the important
contribution that this program can make to cleaning up our lakes
and rivers by having sound water and sewage systems.  These are
not inconsequential projects now or for the future.  These are a
protection of our future. 

There are communities right in this region that cannot develop
their industrial parks because they still have old wooden sewers
from the last century. 
Those are the kinds of investments that are going to be made
under the infrastructure program.  They will allow the
communities of Canada to prosper and grow and provide employment
to this generation and provide a sure economic future for the
next generation.
This program is going to create jobs immediately.  Directly up
to 65,000 jobs will be created in the municipal infrastructure
program and with indirect jobs many more than that.  That is what
the desperate people out there wanting employment, wanting a
better future for themselves and their children, wanting to see
the government doing, and that is what we are doing. 

This is a program municipalities have wanted for 10 years.  I
was sitting on the national board of the Federation of Canadian
Municipalities in 1983.  We were gathering information to
demonstrate the deteriorating nature of the infrastructure of
Canada and the negative impact it was having on our potential for
economic growth and jobs and a better future for our citizens.
Ten years ago the municipalities and the provinces agreed that
this program was what was needed across our country.  The
government is implementing it and will make it a success for
every community across the country. Yet that is the program
endorsed by every municipality the members on the opposite side
by this motion want to cancel. 

They also want to pretend that this is new money we are
spending.  Liberals are responsible in government.  We know that
if we want to implement a new program, and Infrastructure Works
is a new program, then we have to reorder our priorities and that
is what we have done. 

We have not increased spending, no matter what the members on
the other side want to pretend, to create this program.  We have
changed other priorities.  We have cut other spending programs
because we know that this program is important. 

There could be no more ideal time for this kind of investment.
National unemployment is at an unacceptable level.  This is a
terrible waste of human talent, a constant stress on hundreds of
thousands of households across Canada.  Infrastructure Works will
have a significant impact on unemployment. 

The government believes it should keep its promises.  We should
put Canadians back to work.  We should allow our communities to
use the new and innovative technologies in the upgrading of water
and sewage treatments that is going to provide new opportunities
for Canada in the future. 

This program is an investment in the future; in the future of
individual Canadians, in the future of our communities and in the
future of our nation. 

[Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):  Mr. Speaker, I would
just ask the hon. member a question.  Our concern is not whether
it is new money or old money but whether it is borrowed money.
Does she not agree that we are dumping the burden on the next
generation? 

Also does the member not realize that amortizing $6 billion over
the next 10 or 20 or 30 years that we would also pay many times
the original cost of these projects? 

Mrs. Catterall:  Mr. Speaker, the House and Canadians have
had 10 years of promises that would have slashed, burned, cut and
destroyed programs that would bring the debt and the deficit
down.  Has that happened?  No, it has not. 

We have presented a three-year program toward the first real
reduction in the deficit that this nation has seen in many years.
We are going to do it by cutting spending and we have done that
dramatically in this budget.  But we are also going to do it by
increasing the prosperity of the country. 
That is what Canadians want us to do.
If the hon. member's roof was leaking, would he leave it until
it collapsed and he had to replace the whole roof?  If his
foundation was leaking, would he allow it to fall to pieces
before he replaced it?  If there was poison in his water supply,
would he allow his children to drink it?  Of course not. 

If necessary, would he borrow the money to fix those problems?
Of course he would because he knows it costs far more to replace
a broken roof, to replace a basement, or to heal a sick child
than it does to fix the cracks. 

[Translation]
[Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu): Mr. Speaker, I was surprised to 
hear the last speaker talk about the quasi rebirth of Canada under the 
infrastructure program. Of course new infrastructures will create some 
temporary jobs, but the public, the people of Canada were expecting much 
more than that in terms of governmental economic policy. In that 
respect, the red book gave the impression something concrete could be 
achieved.  

When the hon. member talks about spending, why does she claim to 
support this budget if it failed completely, except for promising 
committees would be set up, to address the tax havens enjoyed by certain 
multinational corporations, in particular, and certain billionaires? 

Over $16 billion are reported to be stashed away in tax havens 
every year, which could otherwise bring in hundreds of millions in tax 
revenue for the government. Why has it not been suggested to pay for the 
infrastructure program, this program she speaks so highly of, with the 
money saved by passing a bill on tax havens and another on family 
trusts, instead of making mere gestures, such as the Liberals are 
making, while they ranted and raved against family trusts when they were 
the opposition? 

Why not also collect these hundreds of millions? Why not accept to 
review each departmental budget item? We could easily save, not just 
hundreds of millions, but a few billion dollars which could pay for the 
infrastructure program without increasing the deficit? 

I am surprised that the hon. member only mentions the costs and 
benefits of the infrastructure program. She is not looking for ways, 
however easy, to get money from those who have it, namely the rich, the 
multinational corporations in particular, who benefit from an overly  
permissive policy. 

One last point. Canada's foreign policy should be reviewed. Take 
the Canadian embassy in Tokyo for example. We all know that the market 
value of the lot across from it, which is vacant, is $2 billion and that 
there are potential buyers prepared to pay $2 billion for a piece of 
land next to our embassy. Why not? 

Mrs. Catterall: Mr. Speaker, I find it the hon. member's comments 
rather mean. He knows full well that these things are not included in the 
government's budget. It is very nasty of him to say things like that to 
Canadians, when he knows the truth. For example, the infrastructure 
program is but one phase of our economic strategy, which also includes 
investments in science and technology, as well as measures to help small 
businesses create employment.
The hon. member also knows that we have launched a project to 
review, as he mentioned, each government budget item, in order to 
identify what needs to be done to implement effective programs.  

He knows as well that our budget includes many measures to 
eliminate the tax shelters he complained about. I do not object to 
hearing dissenting opinions in this House but, for the sake of our 
fellow Canadians, we must be honest.  

[English]
Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin--St. George's):  Mr. Speaker, I
too would like to say a few words on what is at the very least a
fairly interesting motion.  The motion says in part that the
budget plan of the government is not the solution to Canada's
debt and deficit problem. 

I will come back to that in a few moments but I would like to go
to some other parts of the motion.  I would have thought the
gentleman from Lethbridge with his long experience would have
known better than to incorporate things in a motion which are
already in effect or have been done. 

The member for North Vancouver can laugh.  Let me refer him to
section (c) of the resolution and let us see if he will laugh.  I
mention him for the very particular reason that his constituents
will know he is identifying with the blatant falsehood contained
in section (c). 

The falsehood is it calls on the House and the government to
produce quarterly reports on the progress being made on deficit
reduction.  I ask the laughing, much amused member for North
Vancouver:  As a member of this House and as a Canadian who, if
we listen to his rhetoric, is very concerned about the deficit,
does he not know there is a document produced regularly?  It is
``The Fiscal Monitor'' put out by the Department of Finance.  It
reports not just quarterly as called for by the motion, but
monthly. 

Mr. White (North Vancouver):  The finance minister said
the people of Canada cannot understand it. 

Mr. Simmons:  Mr. Speaker, I am sure in time you will have
the charity to allow my friend from North Vancouver to say his
few words.  When he does rise I hope he will realize that
something which is blatantly false cannot be be embodied in a
resolution.   It is blatantly false. 

He changes his tune now.  He says, yes it is there but they
cannot understand it.  Well, that is a different issue. Had his
friend from Lethbridge said to produce something that is
understandable, but that is not what he said.  By implication he
gave the impression to the people of Canada and particularly to
this House that the progress report is not happening.  I say to
him it is happening on a regular basis in a document called ``The
Fiscal Monitor''. 

I am glad for this resolution and glad for this opportunity. It
puts into focus two fundamentally differing views on the role of
government. 

On the one hand there is this punitive philosophy underlying the
opposition motion.  It says that government has little to offer
the economy, that government by its very nature cannot help the
jobless.  That is not a perspective I subscribe to.  It is a
perspective I can understand.  I do not endorse it but I can
respect it.  I can respect the gentleman from Lethbridge for
having that point of view.  That perspective mixes the worst
aspects of do nothing corporatism with the slash and trash public
posturing of which my friend from Ottawa West talked about a few
moments ago. 

More to the point, the philosophy which underlies this
resolution is the very philosophy the people of Canada rejected
outright last fall.  It is the philosophy the Tories paraded in
this Chamber for a decade and you know what happened to them.  If
you are not sure, have you heard about the Dodo bird?  They both
went the same way and for the same reason:  They were out of tune
with the times. 
This slash and burn philosophy has been rejected outright by
Canadians.
The member for North Vancouver is seized with the importance of
having a fiscal monitor that is understood by people who do not
have doctorate degrees in economics.  I must say, somewhat
sheepishly, that several of my constituents do not have doctorate
degrees in economics but they know what it is to buy groceries.
Let me put it very explicitly for the member for North Vancouver
in terms of buying the groceries. 

This is what the resolution of the gentleman from Lethbridge
says in effect in its simplest terms.  I will use a little
parable. 

A family of four has to buy some groceries. I did some checking
and found that a family of four on an income of about $30,000 a
year spends about $7,000 a year on groceries.  If they are a
fairly typical Canadian family they spend maybe $600 to $700 on a
mortgage and about $200 to $300 on a car. 

One day the breadwinner in that family has a bright idea.  The
light goes on and he calls the family together.  He or she,
whoever the breadwinner is, calls in the spouse and the two
children and says:  ``I have a bright idea.  Do you know what is
killing us and why we can never get ahead?  We are paying $600 a
month on our mortgage and another couple of hundred dollars on
the car loan.  But do you know what is really killing us?  We are
spending $7,000 a year on groceries.  I have a bright idea.  We
will pay twice as much on the mortgage and not buy any groceries
for a whole year.  No groceries for a whole year''. 

We all agree that would bring down the mortgage a lot faster. It
certainly would.  Just buy no groceries for a whole year and
there is an extra $7,000 to put toward the mortgage or to pay the
car loan off. 

I see some of the brighter members of the Chamber have twigged
to the problem.   They are actually asking:  ``What are those
people going to eat for a year?''  There is the rub.  That is
what my friend from North Vancouver had not thought about, what
they are going to eat for a year. 

As Marie Antoinette said, let them eat cake, but even cake costs
money these days.  What are they going to eat for that whole year
while they are rushing madly to pay down their deficit, their
accumulated debt, their mortgage?  I think I have made my point
that whether it is a family or a nation these things have to be
done in balance.  Those people who say that all we have to be
preoccupied with is deficit elimination to the exclusion of
everything else are not just preaching a very naive doctrine,
they are misleading a lot of people. 

Let us go back to section (a) of the resolution of the gentleman
from Lethbridge.  Here is his solution.  It is the grocery
analogy I mentioned a moment ago.  It is the same idea under
different terms:  cut out the groceries, do not buy any groceries
for a year. 

The hon. member says to place a moratorium on all new spending
programs, such as youth service corps which represents 17,500 new
jobs. The infrastructure program represents 65,000 new jobs.
Residential rehabilitation assistance program represents several
thousands of more new jobs. 

Let the word go out.  At least one member of the Reform Party,
the gentleman from Lethbridge says in writing so we have to take
the man at his word, would immediately move to aggravate the job
situation in this country by another 100,000 jobs. 

This budget is about several things.
Yes, it is about deficit reduction but it can never be about
that alone.  Yes, it is about job creation.  The gentleman in his
motion has identified three or four particular programs but he
identifies them for the purpose of asking us as a House to wipe
them out, to wipe out those 100 jobs, and to drive up the
unemployment rate another point or two. 

As I said before, I respect the other point of view.  I have
difficulty understanding why it is being advanced.  It makes no
sense.  It is a one-track mind approach.  We all know about the
mother whose son enlisted in the military.  Being a proud mother,
she went down to the parade square to watch him on parade the
first day. Being an insightful mother, she noticed something in
particular. She noticed that when the drums started and the
drummer beat out the left, right, left, right, left, right and
the several hundreds of men and women went down the parade
square, Johnny was the only one in step.  Johnny was the only one
in step. 

We see in editorials across this country such as in Calgary
``Martin is headed in the right direction'' and in Edmonton ``It
is solemn and thoughtful and full of well worked out details.
There are real spending cuts in this budget''.  This is what the
editorialist says in the Edmonton Journal. 

From the Canadian Chamber of Commerce we have this:  ``I think
it is a doable budget''.  I could go to other parts but I have
run out of time.  I appeal to my friend from Lethbridge not to be
Johnny on this one.  Get in step with what the people said last
fall.  Get in step with what the editorialists are saying.  Get
in step with what the people are saying. 

The people are saying that we should bring down the deficit but
we should give them some jobs. 

[Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):  Mr. Speaker, I did
enjoy the hon. member's speech, as I always do. 

He mentioned the fiscal monitor but the Minister of Finance said
in this House that the people of Canada cannot understand the
fiscal monitor.  We would like to see it put in a form once a
quarter so that the people of Canada can actually understand
whether the deficit is being addressed or not. 

The problem is that people cannot buy the groceries that the
hon. member was talking about.  To buy $7,000 worth of groceries,
they need to have $14,000 earned because of the level of taxation
from each level of government. 

Taxes are the problem.  Will the member admit that it is
government overspending and government overborrowing that is the
problem?  That is what creates the high taxes.  Will he admit
that the budget is a fraud, should be scrapped and replaced with
a real plan to get control of spending, to reduce taxes and to
create jobs? 

Mr. Simmons:  Mr. Speaker, on the member's suggestion
about the fiscal monitor, if he wants to bring in a motion that
will call for a simplified fiscal monitor, I will second the
resolution for him.  I am with him on that issue. 

However, listening  to the last bit of juicy stuff toward the
end, he lunched too long today.  The subsidized food is getting
to him.  He talks about a fraud and this kind of thing.  Does he
not understand or have enough charity to accept that even if
people on this side of the House did not do exactly what he would
want us to do at least we have the goodwill to do our best? 

To suggest it is fraudulent is an insult to well intended
members of this House.  I do not think he meant that for a
second.  It was one of those throw away phrases in the heat of
debate which he regrets already.  I can tell by the remorse on
his face. 

[Translation]
[Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu): Mr. Speaker, I was not surprised 
that the Liberal member who just spoke ignored the concerns of the 
opposition parties regarding the deficit, because to the Liberals, 
deficits are part of their culture. In fact, they invented them.  Our 
big deficits started with Mr. Turner in 1972, 1974 and 1975, and in 
1981, when the Liberals forecast a $16 billion deficit, they waited for 
16 months before bringing down a budget and then produced a deficit of 
$38 billion by the end of 1983.  
So it is perfectly normal for the Liberal member who is part of this 
Liberal culture and who has been sitting as a Liberal for a long time to 
be unconcerned about deficits.  To them, deficits were never something 
to worry about. It was just too much trouble.
I also wish to tell him that in my riding, after the Budget was 
brought down, a Budget that attacked the unemployed instead of 
employment, the unemployed in my riding were asking: What is the 
difference between a Liberal member and the unemployed? And the answer 
was.  The unemployed used to work. 

And we could also say, when we hear the Minister of Finance bring 
down a budget like this, that in my riding--and you come from a nice 
part of Eastern Canada where there are wonderful oysters, well, we found 
a new way to open them, and I was talking to people from Eastern Canada 
who came down to demonstrate in front of Saint-Jean--just a minute Mr. 
Speaker, I am finishing my sentence--against the closing of the 
military college, and they said this--Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
finish so that my colleague will have a chance to respond. 

The Deputy Speaker: Order. I believe he has clearly understood the 
question. The hon. member for Burin-St. George's. 

[English]
Mr. Simmons:  Mr. Speaker, as always I thank my friend
from Richelieu for his spirited participation in the debate.  I
am in English for two reasons.  My French is lousy and I want to
reach for a metaphor that I cannot translate yet. 

We in Newfoundland talk about the pot calling the kettle black.
I seem to remember that there used to be a person with the same
surname representing the same riding of Richelieu who sat in this
House for the Tory Party between 1984 and 1990.  As a matter of
fact he had somewhat the same features as the gentleman who just
spoke.  If I may just-- 

The Deputy Speaker:  The time has expired.  Sauce for the
goose is sauce for the gander. 

[Translation]
Mr. Jean Leroux (Shefford): Mr. Speaker, we have almost reached the 
end of the period provided under the Standing Orders for debate on the 
opposition motion presented by the hon. member for the Reform Party, 
concerning the Budget Plan for 1994.  

I think the motion presented by the Reform Party is only a partial 
response to the expectations and policies I am about to explain, 
regarding the Budget, job creation and cuts in public spending. 

As you know, Canada's economy is the worst among G-7 countries.  
Recession, deficit and unemployment have become household words, 
unfortunately! Canada's monetary policy, although aimed at controlling 
inflation, merely exacerbates endemic unemployment in this country.  
Lacklustre job creation and the deterioration of Canada's public 
finances are largely responsible for the lack of vigour of our economy.  
It is not a pretty picture. 

This lack of economic growth which has affected Canada for many 
years has led to some very serious consequences for Canada and Quebec. 
This lack of economic growth was followed by budgetary irresponsibility 
in federal public finances. At first, the Canadian government borrowed 
to finance existing and new programs. Subsequently, it had to borrow to 
pay the interest on previous loans, and now we are caught up in this 
debt cycle.  Interest payments on the national debt have absorbed an 
increasingly larger proportion of government revenues. That is where we 
are now.  

The debt's spiral has slowed somewhat, but this government's fiscal 
policy defies all logic.
The government is doing more to increase its tax revenue than to 
control its spending.   

In pre-budget consultations, the Minister of Finance implied that 
he clearly understood the financial reality facing the federal 
government.  It was an especially rude awakening when he announced a 
projected deficit of $39.7 billion.  The saddest part is that the public 
servants whose salaries are frozen, the military people who are losing 
their jobs, like the other victims of the Minister of Finance, the 
elderly and the unemployed, are being sacrificed for almost nothing. 

We are no further ahead in reducing the deficit.  We might as well 
say that the effort to reduce the deficit is practically non-existent.  
In its 1994 budget, the government wants to finance its projected budget 
deficit for 1994-95 by a very clear increase in direct individual and 
corporate income taxes.  I refer here to the revenue projections in the 
finance minister's budget plan, where direct taxes are the only revenue 
in the Budget which could enable the government to achieve this deficit 
objective of $39.7 billion. 

Does the government really think that it can tax the people of 
Quebec and Canada more?  It is disturbing to see that one of the 
solutions adopted by the government is to increase the tax burden of 
middle-income seniors and of middle-class taxpayers in general. 

Consumers have lost confidence in the economy.  The financial 
markets are skeptical about promises to balance future budgets.  In 
fact, the government has not made the cuts needed to reduce tax rates in 
the medium term and to revive the confidence of Quebecers and Canadians. 

It is glaringly obvious: unemployment has not come down from its 
high rate.  In February, Statistics Canada reported a rate of 11.1 per 
cent for all of Canada, while Quebec recorded an average rate of 12.5 
per cent.  Young people employed full time and men employed part time 
accounted for most of the lost jobs.  Statistics Canada estimates that 
the labour force declined by 15,000, a sign that many Canadians have 
given up looking for work. 

The Minister of Finance is continuing the conservative policy of 
lower benefits for most of the people. 
The measure concerning low-income people with dependent children only 
hides its desire to save. It is a Tory policy with a compassionate face. 

Young people will once again be the victims of reform. These 
measures will limit access and push some of these people towards social 
assistance. Eastern Canada, including Quebec, will be hit especially 
hard by the elimination of regional unemployment scales above 13 per 
cent and by the reduced number of weeks of benefits. 

The unemployment problem in Canada and Quebec is that there are not 
enough jobs for everyone and that people must go from one short-term job 
to the next. It is not with 45,000 temporary jobs that we will give 
renewed hope to the 1,590,000 unemployed in Canada, of whom 500,000 are 
in Quebec.
Has the time not come to reconsider work sharing for those who want 
it, to put all those people back to work and return to a full-employment 
policy? Furthermore, it is urgent that the government turn the situation 
around to favour the development of small and medium-sized businesses 
throughout Quebec and Canada. Small and medium-sized businesses create 
jobs and generate wealth. The government missed this goal it should have 
emphasized more.  

Today, too many urban centres look like disaster areas. Social 
inequalities are getting worse at school and in the labour market, and 
we are shocked by the brutal return of physical and moral poverty. 
Everyone can see the homeless on the streets but few of us know that 
food banks are stretched to the limit.  
There is no more space. It is always the weakest who must pay when 
economic growth slows to a standstill, as you and I know. 

According to the 1991 census data, the Montreal metropolitan area 
holds the Canadian record for the highest poverty level: 22 per cent of 
the population. Behind this figure is a social reality that Canadian 
federalism cannot be proud of. It is still possible to give Canadians 
the social programs they need if we see them as a right and a necessity 
rather than a luxury.  

Instead of proposing measures for a healthy distribution of wealth 
throughout the country, the government is going after the middle class 
and questioning the universality of social programs, even though this 
policy promotes social cohesion. 
In this regard, the Bloc Quebecois supports investments to consolidate 
the existing infrastructure, create jobs and lower the unemployment 
rate, provided that Quebec be the main authority responsible. 

[English]
Point (a) of the pending opposition motion presented by the
Reform Party goes against these objectives of economic
development for the regions.  The moratorium on all new pending
programs announced in the budget is not compatible with our
objective of regional development. 

[Translation]
Mr. Speaker, I will now turn my attention more specifically to the 
public spending cuts announced in the latest budget. 

The Minister of Finance recently announced that program spending 
would be reduced by restructuring the social security system, reforming 
the unemployment insurance system and reducing transfers to individuals, 
for example, family allowance payments.  However, the minister also 
announced that total budgetary spending would increase by $2.8 billion 
until 1996.  This increase includes debt servicing charges.  In fact, 
despite the cuts announced by the government, overall program spending 
will continue to increase.  In essence, all the government is doing is 
reallocating expenditures without actually reducing government program 
spending. 
It is not tackling head-on cases of waste and mismanagement within the 
system.  Instead, it is targeting social programs. 

The government has not addressed the root of the problem.  Instead, 
like its conservative predecessors, it hopes that the anemic economic 
recovery--a recovery that it has failed to stimulate--will get state 
revenues back on track.  The government's economic growth and inflation 
hypotheses are realistic. 
What is not realistic, however, given the growth of the underground 
economy, is the government's belief, as reflected in the budget, that 
government revenues will increase at a faster rate than the Gross 
Domestic Product.  In short, the government is counting on the weak 
recovery to bring down the current deficit.
How, under the circumstances, can the government justify increasing 
its level of spending, all the more so when we know that it is currently 
seeking the authority to borrow $34.3 billion for 1994-95 in order to 
meet its financial commitments? 

Mr. Speaker, I find it unconscionable that the budget provides for 
an increase in public spending up until 1996.  It is absolutely 
essential for the government to eliminate waste before it can put public 
finances in order. 
The government must give the example; it must restore public confidence 
as well as its own respectability. There are a lot more savings to be 
made by eliminating waste than by making cuts to social programs. 
Freezing public servants' salaries, restructuring public services and 
increasing the middle class tax burden are last resort solutions. There 
are other options still.  

For the last three years, the Auditor General has identified waste 
or unnecessary expenditures totalling no less than $5 billion annually.  
This year, the Auditor General has discovered $700 million more in 
squandering than in the previous fiscal year.  

Merely implementing the Auditor's recommendations would bring 
enormous relief, without any tax increase or social programs cuts. The 
equation is a simple one.  

Taxpayers are fed up because they feel that the government is 
wasting public money and is after the middle class, which is 
overburdened with taxes. Five years ago, governments were making the 
same frivolous expenditures and wasting just as much, but nobody said 
anything. Today, because of the pressures resulting from the appalling 
state of public finances, such mismanagement is strongly denounced.  

Fiscal consolidation is a necessary measure at the federal level to 
restore confidence among Quebecers and Canadians.  

The chronic weakness of our economy is not due to a bad performance 
of our foreign trade but, rather, to the stagnation of domestic demand. 
The deficit must also be reduced because interests on Canada's foreign 
debt are the highest among G-7 countries. 

Deficit reduction is conditional upon reducing public spending and 
waste, as well as eliminating tax unfairness. This streamlining exercise 
could result in savings of $10 billion. Of that amount, five billion 
dollars could be invested to stimulate employment, including by building 
a high-speed train line, whereas the other five billion could be used to 
reduce the deficit. Such an initiative would do a lot to restore 
taxpayers' confidence.  

The government must give the example and restore public confidence. 
A true social contract must be based on a sound and balanced tax system. 
Unfortunately, it is a fact that over the last two decades governments 
have only contributed to create an imbalance between taxes paid and 
services provided by the state to taxpayers.  

In order to eliminate waste, unnecessary spending and mismanagement 
within the government administration, the Bloc Quebecois proposed that 
the government set up a parliamentary committee to review each budget 
spending item, and it is asking that such a committee be created.
Setting up such a committee is justified because the latest Auditor 
General's report showed that Quebecers and Canadians who believed that 
some public funds went to waste were right. 

[English]
That is the reason we want to create an analytical and revision
committee of the governmental spending programs formed by elected
representatives and not by civil servants.  We believe elected
representatives are entitled to supervise and ensure that the
objectives of the different spending programs comply and that the
allocated public funds are spent with efficiency, effectiveness
and equity. 

We believe that Parliament does not receive the appropriate
information pertaining to the results of the different ministries
and crown corporations wasting thousands of millions of dollars
of taxpayers' money. 

Guided by the report of the Auditor General of Canada we believe
that the wasted public funds and the different cases of
mismanagement are drops in the ocean. 

[Translation]
A parliamentary committee responsible for reviewing government 
expenditures, item by item, could ensure that Parliament and thus the 
public be better informed of the government's financial situation. So, 
we encourage the Reform Party to support the establishment of the 
parliamentary committee on the item-by-item review of government 
expenditures to enable us to keep a closer eye on how public funds are 
managed, which will greatly help bring the deficit down. 

I do support point ``C'' of the motion, regarding the production of 
quarterly reports on the progress made on deficit reduction. With 
regular status reports, I think we will be able to set realistic 
deadlines to achieve our goals.  

[Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough): Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his remarks. 

[English]
I would like to ask his opinion about a particular part of the
motion to which he was speaking.  This, as he knows, is a Reform
Party motion and it is an attack on various things, one of which
is the government's attempts to help young people. 

As has been suggested earlier, other parties in other countries
which have had the Reform Party approach of cutting and burning
have increased their deficits and debts.  They have also produced
very high levels of unemployment.  That has happened in Canada. 

One thing that has not happened yet in Canada is although we
have high unemployment, particularly among young people, we do
not yet have the chronic unemployment which exists in these other
countries, for example Britain and the United States. 

As bad and sad and tragic as high unemployment is, chronic
unemployment for young people is worse.  Chronic unemployment
means that we have a generation which because during its
formative years it has not worked is never really able to work. 
I believe that is a real tragedy. 

In this motion the Reform Party is attacking our attempts to
help young people now.  I believe that it is already late to help
our young people.  They want to leave this to the forces of the
economy.  I believe that to avoid chronic unemployment among
young people we must act now. 

I would like to ask the member what he thinks of the Reform
Party's attempts to cut down the efforts we are making to help
the young people of Canada now.
[Translation]
Mr. Leroux:  Mr. Speaker, as you know, I worked in education for 
many years and I would like to congratulate my colleague opposite on 
what he said about Canada's youth. 

I fully agree with the hon. member that our young people in Canada 
have unfortunately been sacrificed and that at this stage there does not 
seem to be a policy in the budget to put our young people to work--I 
will not say back to work.  I think it is catastrophic for Canada to 
have young people who want to earn their living one day preparing and 
studying very hard without even a chance of starting to work or else 
having to accept work that is far less than what they could do.  I agree 
with the hon. member. 

What we said and what we are saying is that the budget will not 
spur economic recovery.  The budget that we debated only plugs the holes 
and I think that it is a very small-c conservative budget, and possibly 
a Conservative budget as well. 

Now I think, as the Bloc proposed--it is an attractive idea--we 
should form a committee of the House, not a joint committee of the House 
and the Senate, but a committee of the people's elected representatives 
to look together at the government's spending item by item, so that we, 
the people's elected representatives--because when we go back to our 
ridings and when people talk about politicians in Canada, they are 
talking about us here in this House, and I think that we have a 
responsibility--should be able to review the budgets item by item and be 
able to make cuts where required to get the money and help create jobs. 

Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy Prime 
Minister and Minister of the Environment): Mr. Speaker, it is with 
alacrity that I take part in this debate today and welcome the 
opportunity to present the true picture of the government's plans to 
help Canadian young people help themselves to a more promising and 
prosperous future. 

Let me begin by setting the record straight.  Contrary to the 
assumption put forward by the hon. member from Lethbridge, the budget 
for the Youth Service Corps does not represent new spending.  The Youth 
Service Corps will, in fact, be implemented using departmental resources 
and money from cost saving initiatives announced in the February 22, 
1994 Federal Budget,  pursuant to commitments made in the red book.  The 
Youth Service Corps will not put any additional pressures on our 
national debt. 
I can assure the House we will still see a drop in the deficit, down to 
3 per cent of GNP, over the next few years, in line with our budget 
projections. 

I believe, however, that my colleague from Lethbridge and other 
members of his party are being very short-sighted if they are prepared 
to short-change our youth. 

Investing in young people is more than just a matter of dollars and 
cents.
Common sense and fairness dictate that the government must act to 
respond to the very difficult reality facing Canadian youth.  Perhaps 
the hon. member does not appreciate just how grave the current situation 
is. 

Let me remind the House that, for adolescents and young adults, the 
recession started sooner and is lasting much longer. 

The most recent labour force survey shows that, while the number of 
unemployed in Canada is down, the youth unemployment rate is rising. 
It reached 18.1 per cent last month, its highest level since last June.  
These are the official figures on young unemployed and do not take into 
account many more young people who do not show up on UI lists. 

Let me put that into context.  The hon. member represents 
Lethbridge which, according to the latest census, has a population of 
roughly 54,000.  Compare that to the number of young people currently 
outside the job market--at last count 428,000.  That is almost eight 
times the population of the city of Lethbridge.  Young people are 
searching for relevant work experience that will give them saleable 
skills to get their foot in the job market door.  Are these the people 
the hon. member from Lethbridge would penalize?  Is he prepared to tell 
them we do not think they are worth the money? 

At this time, I want to digress to pay tribute to a colleague of 
mine, honourable senator Jacques Hébert, for his achievements and his 
tremendous dedication to young Canadians.  Through Katimavik, our young 
learned to help each other.  They learned how to become more confident, 
more enlightened and more tolerant.  They learned to make sacrifices 
throughout the world to help enhance the standard of living of many of 
our friends in Southern countries, for whom life is sometimes a matter 
of survival. 

It is obvious that it is in our collective best interests to 
nurture and support the very people who will be tomorrow's workers and 
taxpayers.  On economic grounds alone, the arguments are clear.  Canada 
simply cannot afford a lost generation. 
Demographic trends clearly demonstrate that Canada will soon suffer a 
worker shortage.  As baby boomers leave the workforce in large numbers, 
as they tend to do more and more often, we will increasingly count on 
our young. 

We will count on our young people to take over from us.  They are 
our hope and tomorrow's leaders.  

[English]
To compete globally in the next century we will need a highly
educated, highly skilled workforce.  One needs not be a futurist
to know that our continued growth and prosperity depend on the
workers of tomorrow, the unemployed youth of today. 

There is evidence to suggest that young people who do not form
an economic attachment to the labour force today will have much
more difficulty in finding and keeping employment in the future. 

To suggest that we should not place a spending priority on our
most precious resource, our young people, leaves me questioning
the commitment of the Reform Party to Canadian youth. 

Even more convincing than the economic case is the moral
imperative to provide our children with a sense of security,
fairness and hope for their future well-being which is also our
collective future.
It is heartbreaking to see young people brimming with ideas and
ambition, very often far better educated than their elders,
unable to apply their skills, their talents and their knowledge. 

How can any of us in the elder generation be indifferent to
their frustration, to their hopelessness, to their despair of
today?  It is completely unacceptable that so many young
Canadians today have no place to put their energy to constructive
use.  I believe that every member of the House has a duty to
ensure that Canadian youth do not feel rejected or ignored. 

We must assure them that we appreciate not only their years of
hard work acquiring an education but also their proven
willingness to work and contribute to the commonweal.  We must
clearly demonstrate that we are committed to helping them achieve
their enormous potential and that we will work with them to
accomplish their goals. 

The government intends to do exactly that.  We will bring the
Liberal vision for youth to life.  We are determined to implement
the strategies laid out in the red book which describe our action
plan for young Canadians. 

The youth service corps is a key part of the Liberal promise to
create jobs, to restore hope and build a stronger Canada.  The
youth service corps will provide productive ways to help young
people through the transition from school to the workplace. 

[Translation]
The Youth Service Corps has four main objectives: community 
service, understanding Canada, environmental awareness and personal 
development. 

I hope no one will question how valuable the young are in our 
society.  It is important to give our young people the tools they need 
to prepare a better future for themselves by contributing to the 
building of our nation.  Significant measures will have to be taken, and 
I think the Youth Service Corps is one of them.  So, I would ask the 
hon. member from Lethbridge: Who would see anything wrong with the Youth 
Service Corps? 

[English]
[Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo--Chilcotin):  Mr. Speaker, I
would like to thank the hon. member for his comments.  Many of
them I can agree with.  Some of them are points that I have
difficulty accepting. 

I am in full agreement with the statement that it is completely
unacceptable that young people have no place to put their
energies.  However there is a moral imperative for the youth to
have a meaningful place in our society.  I agree with those
statements wholeheartedly.  I do have difficulty accepting a
statement regarding short term views concerning the rights of
youth and ascribing that to the Reform Party and to the position
that we take. 

We are watching from a view of history which we have watched
through the 1970s when the Liberal Party was governing, through
the 1980s when the Conservatives took charge.  We are at a place
now where we are economically unable to continue with those types
of policies.  To suggest that the Reform Party at this point
comes with this resolution with no view of history does not make
sense to me. 

With the statements that the hon. member has made, how does he
square those statements and his condemnation of the Reform Party
with the history of the performance of the Liberals and the
Conservative governments in the past? 
We are looking for a means to hold the economy together so there
will be hope, there will be promise, there will be a meaningful
future for our children.
As I see it, where the government intrudes, where the government
takes control, where the government creates pigeon holes and
expects people to fit into those pigeon holes, it has never
worked.  Therefore we are suggesting that it is time to put the
initiative in the hands of grassroots men and women, to leave
them with the financial resources to do the job that government
has never been able to do and to have the government step back
and leave private industry, individuals, the entrepreneurial
spirit to do the work that has not been done before, to build the
nation. 

Mr. Lincoln:  Mr. Speaker, this is the fundamental
difference that separates us from the Reform Party and the member
laid it out very clearly. 

There was an election in October, as I remember, and our party
ran on a platform that said certain budgets were going to be
transferred to key job creation programs.  One of the key job
creation programs which was much more than a job creation
program, it was also a social program of great importance, was to
say that if we look at the situation of our youth today the great
majority of whom are leaving school do not know where to go for
work.  There is a shortage of hope.  There is complete despair. 

I do not know if the member feels the same as I do.  When in my
riding I meet all kinds of young people.  I could send him a a
pile of CVs from young people, highly qualified, with masters and
doctorates who cannot find work today. 

The government has started to say: ``We have to transfer money,
especially from the defence fund at a time when the cold war is
over, into a youth services corps for young Canadians''.  The
great majority of Canadians obviously back this theory because
they elected us in large numbers as a majority party.  They did
not elect the Reform Party with their view that the marketplace,
the economy, dollars and cents will cure every problem.  If it
had been so in the past we would not have had trade unions.  We
would not have had reforms of the social safety net.  We would
not have medicare.  We would have left it to the marketplace to
sort it out. 

In all places where the marketplace is paramount and exclusive
the social fabric of the country is in disarray.  We do not say
that government intervention is the only way to move, but surely
there is a mix there in establishing constructive, social
policies that can have government take a sense of direction, and
give leadership.  It seems to us that if we want to give
leadership the first place to put the accent is on our youth.  I
am very proud that we have this program in place.

[Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières): Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for my hon. colleague concerning the general position of the 
Liberal government and how it compares to the position taken during the 
election campaign.  As the months go by, I find that this government is 
getting better and better at half-measures.  This is clear from the red 
book, long on theory, by the way, where it is stated that last fall, 
there were 1.6 million unemployed in Canada.  And what is the government 
doing to solve the unemployment problem? 
Well, it has set up an infrastructure program that will create 45,000 
short-term jobs--15,000 in Quebec--in response to a situation where 1.6 
million Canadians and 428,000 Quebecers are unemployed. 

With respect more specifically to youth unemployment, the 
government has come up with another half-measure, namely a Youth Service 
Corps.  This program will not resolve anything or create jobs.  However, 
on the eve of a referendum, one component of the program will, judging 
from what the government member said earlier, enable young Canadians to 
travel and to learn more about Canada. We all know what the implications 
of this can be, what a man such as Mr. Jacques Hébert can accomplish. 
We all know what the implications can be.  I would like my hon. 
colleague to explain to us how this Youth Services Corps is not 
fundamentally a very political move by this government on the eve of the 
referendum?
Mr. Lincoln: Mr. Speaker, last October, we presented to the 
Canadian public a very comprehensive program.  It did not focus solely 
on youth.  I used young people as an example.  Our program covered the 
entire social structure in Canada.  It outlined our agenda in such areas 
as research and development where we pledged our support to the tune 
of 25 per cent for environmental research and development; 
it announced a comprehensive 
apprenticeship program for the next four years, a youth services corps 
and an infrastructure program.  I would remind my colleague who speaks 
of 45,000 jobs that Statistics Canada reports that last month,
66,000 new jobs were created.  Therefore, his figures are not correct.  
They should be 50 per cent higher. 

Mr. Plamondon: Not with that budget. 

Mr. Lincoln: What I mean is that-- 

The Deputy Speaker:  Order! The parliamentary secretary's time has 
expired.  Resuming debate, the Chair recognizes the hon. secretary to 
the Minister of Finance. 

Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance): 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to have an opportunity to speak 
with you today about the new Canadian Engineers and Scientists 
Program announced in the budget.

This government is committed to sharpening up Canada's 
competitive edge and developing the kinds of technological 
capabilities that translate into new business and jobs. With as 
much as 85 per cent of new jobs being created by small and 
medium-sized businesses, we have placed a very high priority on 
support for these enterprises.

One of these measures is the creation of the Engineers and 
Scientists Program. As announced in the budget, $10 million a 
year have been earmarked to implement the Canadian Engineers and 
Scientist Program. To help Canadian businesses build up 
technological capabilities, when it begins early next year, the 
program will provide salary support to assist small and 
medium-sized manufacturing firms in meeting their needs for 
technical personnel.

[English]
One of these measures is the creation of the engineers and
scientific program.  When it begins the program will provide
support all across the country.  It is intended to help firms
develop long term technological capabilities, not just short term
project base needs. 

It is designed to fill a gap in technological expertise that
often hinders small enterprises from achieving their true
potential whether in product development, productivity or both.
Clearly a company that has no one with current technological
skills or training has a difficult time introducing the level of
innovation that can help the company to grow and create more
jobs. 

The federal government can facilitate growth through this type
of national program.  We can help set the stage for these firms
to adjust to the significant development in manufacturing taking
place around the world. 

The program can provide an important focus for firms that have a
potential to export. I think this is so important.  We have to
change the fact that over 90 per cent of Canadian firms do not
export.  Innovation and technological transfers are the keys to
success to the kind of economy we need to have for the future. We
have to look for new ways to solve old problems.  We have to make
sure Canadian manufacturers develop a high degree of technology
based expertise.  It is absolutely vital to any long term
competitiveness and profitability in Canadian manufacturing. 

While technology transfers are often difficult to define and
measure we know that Canada has been weaker than most of its
competitors.  We need to work together to turn this around.  We
need to develop a program that is easy to use and is responsive
to real need. 

Statistics Canada just released a study entitled ``Strategies
for Success, a Profile of Growing Small and Medium Sized
Enterprise in Canada''. 
In this study it is confirmed that innovation is a key factor
that separates successful small and medium sized businesses from
the unsuccessful ones.  To succeed firms need to be able to
innovate.
However this is one of the problems we face in Canada.  A recent
survey of over 9,000 small and medium sized manufacturing firms
in Quebec show that slightly more than 10 per cent of the firms
employ one or more engineers, with only 2,400 engineers in total
being employed.  This shows the need for investment in this area.
We must invest so that our small and medium sized firms can
prosper. 

[Translation]
We all want to see Canadian companies establish a strong global 
competitive position. We want to see manufacturing jobs stay in 
Canada. The federal government is committed to working with the 
provinces, business, labour and Canadian workers to help the 
process along.

The Canadian Engineers and Scientists Program will no doubt be a 
vital part of that success.

[English]
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):  Mr. Speaker, I am
pleased to be speaking today to the motion which addresses some
of the problems of the recently announced budget. 

Last Monday when I spoke to Bill C-14, the authority to borrow
up to $37 billion more on the backs of the young people of
Canada, I said I wished that government members would vote
against the bill in order to avoid mortgaging the futures of
their children and grandchildren. 

Unfortunately my pleas were not heard or they were not
understood or they were not convincing enough.  For whatever
reason absolutely not one government member voted against adding
another $1,450 in mortgaged future to every man, woman and child
in the country.  Government members refused to acknowledge or are
incapable of understanding the seriousness of the problem and
they voted for Bill C-14. 

As one person put it, because of the budget the light at the end
of the tunnel has been turned out until further notice.  No light
at the end of the tunnel usually means there is a wall at the end
of the tunnel.  We do not have to keep speeding into a dark
tunnel on this train of out of control debt.  There is a chance
for government members to help stop the train. 

What is needed, among other things, is for them to support the
motion before us today, a motion that would foster co-operation,
to place caps on spending and to develop a spending contingency
plan that will stop piling debt on to our children and
grandchildren. 

Of course government members are always worried that our real
plan is to overthrow the government so that we can have another
election.  I would just like to say to them that this is simply
not true.  We believe in stability in government and we will
support any government at this critical time that is prepared to
address seriously the issues of deficit and debt. 

Government members should be placing partisan politics in second
place and start admitting that Reform MPs are telling the truth
about the seriousness of the problem.  If they do not believe
there is a problem they should think about what has happened in
Ontario.  They should ask themselves:  If government spending was
the answer to the problems, how come the premier of the province
of Ontario has had to abandon his program of $13 billion
deficits?  If it did not work for Ontario, how can it work for
Canada? 

The fact is that government deficits kill the economy.
Government deficits lead to high taxation and excessive
regulation.  Government deficits suck the wealth out of the
private sector and destroy hopes for the future.  Government
deficits turn out the light at the end of the tunnel. 

I find it hard to believe that at least some of the government
members have not realized that the government, like ones before
it, has a spending problem, not a revenue problem.  I find it
hard to believe that at least some of them have not realized that
we have reached tax saturation point, that it is time to abandon
these possibilities of widening the tax base.  It is time to
realize that increasing taxes will only lead to a bigger
underground economy. 
Prior to the 1993 election Reform was the underdog.  If this
government does not wake up, it will find that after the 1993
election Reform is the watchdog and after the next election we
will be the top dog.
The best way for government members to retain their seats in the
next election and to prevent Reform from winning is to support
the motion before us today.  That is another bit of the free
advice I give occasionally to government members to help them
with their re-election. 

I know that government members like to say the policies of
Reform are slash and burn.  This is ridiculous rhetoric.  It
really does not contribute anything to solving the problems.  The
people who watch the proceedings of the House of Commons on
television are intelligent, thoughtful people who can see through
that rhetoric.  They understand it for what it is. 

We on this side of the House try to offer constructive
alternatives.  We offer alternatives that are workable and
reasonable.  It would not hurt for a government member to
occasionally vote with us on something that we propose. 

The evidence that we speak the truth is all around us.  The
National Citizens Coalition, which the government would dearly
like to silence, has widely distributed a taxpayers' score card.
If any government member filled it in honestly, they would have
to admit that the government had failed in its budget plans. 

More evidence came right from the horse's mouth, so to speak,
when the deputy finance minister admitted to the public accounts
committee on March 9 that the tax burden on individual Canadians
and corporations is higher than in any other major industrial
power except France and has climbed to almost 40 per cent of the
gross domestic product. 

Peter Cook in the Globe and Mail on the same date wrote: 



Mr. Martin may have convinced himself that economic growth and
the spending cuts he announced will head off a debt crunch, and
he has convinced his boss-- 



Do we know who that is, Mr. Speaker? 



--who is rather easily convinced on this subject.  But at
the great bar of public opinion he is not doing so well.  Not
only has he failed to convince most Canadian economists and the
Canadian media, but he is facing an international audience that
is getting rather peppery and impertinent. 



Reports in the financial circles of Germany and the U.K.
criticized the failure to act on the spending and predicted that
the Canadian dollar would continue to slide.  The proof is out
there for us all to see; another third of a cent drop in the
dollar last Friday, almost four cents since the election.  Is the
government proud of this wonderful achievement? 

Can government members not see that this will lead to higher
interest rates, higher inflation and no possibility of getting
control of this deficit?  Anyone with a calculator can see that
we are already off the targets that were set in that budget. Even
the government's infrastructure program, which was supposed to
kickstart the economy, has become a scandalous wish list of pork
barrel politics and make work projects. 

In a news release on February 18 by British Columbia-Canada
infrastructure works it was revealed that short and long term job
creation are no longer essential criteria.  They have been
reduced to only important criteria.  The item at the top of the
list is now incrementality and/or acceleration of investment,
whatever that means. Let's face it, it is a mess and it is not
going to get better as a result of the budget. 

Our Reform motion today tries to address some of the problems
and it promises co-operation.  If I were a betting man I would
bet that the government members will do the usual thing and vote
against it without having any good reason to do so. 

The Globe and Mail editorial on the morning after the
budget said: 



The budget makes a mockery of Jean Chrétien's promise to return
to the good old days.  In the good old days the future was not
mortgaged to the selfishness and cowardice of the current
generation. 



I am not a coward.  I am prepared to tell it as it is, and I am
not afraid to support decisive action. 

I am also not selfish about it.  I have taken a voluntary pay
cut and refused to sign the form making me eligible for the
gold-plated MPs' pension plan.  I have proven that I am prepared
to make sacrifices to avoid dumping more debt on to the next
generation. 
I can sleep at night because I can say to the next generation
that I tried to stop the debt train in that long dark tunnel
while the government opened the throttle, hoping the light at the
end of the tunnel would reappear only to discover there was a
wall in front of it.
[Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):  Mr. Speaker, I listened
with interest to the member's statement and comments.  I would
like to ask the member a specific question about this motion, in
particular that a moratorium be put on the court challenges
program. 

The motion states a new program.  This court challenges program
is not new.  It was cancelled by the previous government but the
current government, as I understand it, has agreed to reinstate
it.  It is a program that is absolutely essential to provide a
way for disadvantaged groups and equality-seeking and language
rights groups to pursue the rights guaranteed to them under the
charter and the Constitution. 

I know the member will agree with me that the rights of
Canadians are sacred to this nation, but rights without the
ability to implement them and to seek equality in those rights
are in fact meaningless. 

I would say to the member that I know his party's position, very
often stated, is:  Why can't all Canadians just be treated the
same.  I would agree, why can't all Canadians just be treated the
same.  However, in reality and in the real world women,
disadvantaged groups, persons with disabilities and visible
minorities are not treated all the same. 

The intent of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms is to enshrine
in our country the importance that we treat each citizen with
equality. 

I would ask the member how he can justify this program, a
relatively small expenditure, being wiped off the map by the
Reform Party?  Do they not support the equality of all citizens
in this country? 

Mr. White (North Vancouver): Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon.
member for her question. 

We in the Reform Party made it very clear that we support
equality of all people regardless of their race, religion and
province of origin.  In fact I gave a speech to that effect this
morning. 

Specifically the member asked about the court challenges program
and, as she quite correctly stated, it has been reintroduced.  It
was a very expensive program and had been used widely by special
interest groups to press their own agenda on the backs of the
taxpayers who frankly are fed up with this type of government
redistribution of wealth. 

We would favour getting rid of that program again and taking
some load off the backs of the taxpayers. 

[Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria--Haliburton):  Mr. Speaker,
the motion deals with the infrastructure program.  The member for
North Vancouver has indicated nothing in constructive
alternatives to that program. 

I wonder what he wants me to tell the people in the town of
Lindsay and the Lindsay police force which is planning to build a
new building under this plan and the people in the town of
Haliburton who I have met with who have plans to spend money
under the infrastructure program.  We have 30 per cent
unemployment in the town of Haliburton.  What does the member
want me to tell those people who will not get a job because of
that? 

Mr. White (North Vancouver):  Mr. Speaker, I thank the
hon. member for the question. 

Anywhere in this country the portion of funding that comes from
the federal government will be borrowed because the federal
government runs a deficit.  The portion of the money used at the
provincial level will be borrowed because all of the provinces
are running a deficit.  At the municipal level it will mean a
taxation increase for homeowners to fund their portion. 

Reform's answer to all of this is not to keep piling debt on to
people and increasing taxation, but to get control of government
debt so that we can reduce taxation which makes the economy
prosper and everybody is better off. 

The infrastructure program is not creating jobs.  For the most
part all it is doing is expanding a little bit the current
functions of the municipalities without them employing a single
additional person to their present staff.
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo--Chilcotin):  Mr. Speaker,
if an analogy can be used to describe this year's federal budget,
I would suggest the analogy of a rusted out pickup truck patched
with Bondo and painted the same colour as the red ink book. 

The budget is a patch-up job that seems to do very little to
control the source of Canada's deficit problem.  New programs
have been introduced that require even more borrowed money.
Each program represents an attempt to avoid the real problem,
which is the government's lack of will to deal with a nation
crippling deficit. 

The infrastructure program is a large part of this problem
avoidance.  Jobs, jobs, jobs, we heard hon. members opposite cry
on the campaign trail last fall.  The promise of permanent jobs
in this program is an illusion.  The jobs created will last just
as long as government money flows into this infrastructure
program but not much longer.

By the same token, these jobs will not only cause the federal
debt to rise, they will force the other two levels of government
to increase their debts as well.  The finance minister takes
credit for not raising the tax rate. The visible tax rate may not
have been raised but the various arms of government through which
taxes are collected have been extended.  The same taxpayer must
now pay for more federally directed programs through the broader
reach of government. 

The additional debt to be incurred by all levels of government
involved in the infrastructure program will result in about a
$500 million annual increase in the deficits.  This federal
program is demanding that the provincial and municipal levels of
government adopt its policy of increasing deficit spending. 

Some provincial governments like Newfoundland may not fully
participate in this program because they are already too heavily
in debt.  Other provinces have reluctantly conceded to the
program only because of the pressure they receive from the
municipalities. 

Even the municipalities are reluctant to participate because of
the enormous additional expense.  These extra costs go far beyond
what they can reasonably add to their budgeted expenses. However,
because of the extra federal cash available politically both the
provinces and their municipalities must enter this federally
contrived competition for more transfer dollars. 

The problem of paying for this program remains whether the money
is accepted or not.  Whether we take the cash or not we have to
pay the taxman because the money will be spent.  The money will
be borrowed to spend and the burden of paying interest on that
will be borne by the taxpayer. 

Some of the largest cities may view this program from a
completely different perspective.  For them this may be a
windfall.  The federal government has taken on the role of Santa
Claus, granting to them any project within reason that they can
dream up.  Some projects likely to receive funding can hardly be
considered infrastructure types. 

One project likely to gain approval is the Quebec City
convention centre.  Many would question this as infrastructure.
While some communities are in desperate need of infrastructure
upgrading, others will be using these tax dollars for projects
that are ridiculous for financially broke governments to even
consider. 

Can we expect more projects as we saw from the previous
government like the Museum of Humour in Montreal which is a joke
of a project, approved and funded by all three levels of
government? 

Even if we could afford to undertake the Liberal infrastructure
program, it is still flawed.  Municipalities have been provided
only two years to approve and implement projects which must be
completed within just three years. 

Any projects currently in place are not eligible and I fear the
least infrastructure-like projects will get priority in the rush
for approval.  As well, the haste to completion will result in a
lower quality end product with likely cost overruns to be fully
borne by the municipalities.
I am concerned that this infrastructure program will end up
yielding the same results as the Ataratiri Housing Project in
central Toronto which was reported in the press.  The description
of this municipal housing project has similarities to the
infrastructure program.  On this Toronto housing project $265
million was spent and not a single residence was ever built. 

I would like some assurance from the former Mayor of Toronto,
now the hon. minister responsible for the infrastructure program,
that the mistakes made in this Toronto project will not be
repeated again on a $6 billion scale. 

This infrastructure program serves as a reward to many
municipalities that have neglected adequate maintenance. 
Rewarding negligence is found in another program adopted by the
budget, the residential rehabilitation assistance program, or the
RRAP.  This program is designed to assist individuals who own
residences that do not meet adequate living standards. 

The RRAP provides forgivable grants and loans.  Forgivable
grants are loans converted into grants after five years ownership
has passed since the work was completed.  The forgivable grant
portion of the program cost the Canadian taxpayer $53.7 million
in 1993.  Additional fully repayable loans worth $10 million were
also granted.  However, in 1993 almost $1.5 million worth of
previous loans were in default. 

The residential rehabilitation assistance program as I
understand it is intended to raise the standard of housing for
those people with low incomes.  This in itself is a worthy cause.
As worthy as this may be the main problem with this program is
the same problem we have with the infrastructure program. The
RRAP will take another $100 million of borrowed money to finance
it and this borrowed money will be added to the national debt and
then we and our children can pay interest on that also. 

However, there are some other reasons why I resist the RRAP.
They are based upon some knowledge of some of the abuses that
have taken place in the past.  Homes have been renovated and
upgraded with the result being an increased sale value which made
selling the house an attractive option that was taken advantage
of. 

Another aspect I resist is the arrangement to provide loans
which are simply not being repaid as agreed. 

In the budget other costly programs were introduced.  The cost
of scientists and engineers program will be $10 million annually.
It is designed to help businesses hire new technical staff with
government subsidies. A similar program is the youth services
corps which also acts as subsidies to businesses hiring youths. 

As admirable as these programs seem they put businesses which
are able to participate in the program at a competitive advantage
over those that do not quality.  Lowering the cost of research
and production for a business which normally is not competitive
or viable could force other self-sustaining and competitive
business out of the market.  Both these programs have admirable
motives but have potentially dangerous consequences that could
place Canada at a disadvantage in world markets. 

It is always a disappointment for a person who has worked hard
to see his or her business grow and then see a competitor come in
and receive government money that instantaneously makes them ten
times larger than their years of work have accomplished and the
business become unviable because of the artificial competition. 

These programs will have little overall effect on employment but
will force us to maintain current or higher levels of deficit
spending and will not permit any overall lowering of business
taxes which are the greatest stimulus to increased employment.
These programs have the potential of working against the goal
they were designed to achieve. 

The court challenges program was reintroduced in last month's
budget.  Canadian Heritage estimates show a steady increase in
the money to be provided to the court challenges program.  The
amount allocated for the next fiscal year, 1994-95, will be
almost double what was provided in the last full fiscal year
before its cancellation in 1992.
We must also take into consideration that the $35,000 available
per case represents only a small portion of the entire cost that
each case represents in the entire judicial system.  As well,
there are a growing number of people who resent taxpayers' money
being spent to argue for the rights that satisfy agendas more
personal than national. 

The goal of the court challenges program was introduced to help
minority groups challenge the sections of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms.  It would be reasonable to expect that after
14 years of the existence of this charter the number of cases
should be tapering off, not increasing. 

[Mr. Julian Reed (Halton--Peel):    Mr. Speaker, I would
like to ask the hon. member how he would respond to the people in
the municipalities of my riding who have said to me very
enthusiastically that because of the infrastructure program the
municipalities were able to update projects that had to be
delayed in the past because of the recession and that the
benefits will accrue over the next 10 to 15 years, well beyond
the time that the mechanics of the infrastructure program are
under way. 

I wonder how he would respond to that in making the statement
that this is strictly a temporary thing with an end and once it
is over it is over and gone. 

He alluded to that early in his speech. 

Mr. Mayfield:  Mr. Speaker, the problem of money needed to
rebuild and renovate infrastructure within the municipalities is
not a new one.  Municipalities have been short of money for this
type of work for a long time. 

However, the difficulty at this time with borrowing money for
these projects is that this is money that will be added to the
deficit and the debt and will increase the burden upon this
generation and future generations to deal with the real problem
of our economy, the number one economic problem of our nation,
overtaxation.  Every level of government suffers from that
disease. 

[Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough):   Mr. Speaker, the member
spoke about the infrastructure program. 

As the frost comes out of the ground across Canada, hundreds and
thousands of infrastructure projects are going to start creating
jobs, improving our infrastructure and stimulating local
economies.  He spoke about the residential rehab program.
Thousands of Canadians are going to improve their basic
investments in their homes. 

He spoke about the science and engineering program.  Does he
know that whereas in Japan virtually every manufacturing company
with 100 employees has an engineer, virtually none of our
equivalent corporations does. 

My question to the member is can he assure us that no
municipality in his riding is going to take advantage of the
infrastructure program? 

The Deputy Speaker:   Order.  I ask all hon. members that
when they are asked to be brief they do not go on indefinitely. 

Mr. Mayfield:  Mr. Speaker, in a brief answer to the
member's question concerning whether I will ask the
municipalities to assure that they will not accept the money, of
course I will not do that. 

The reason for that is we are going to be taking part in paying
for this project whether we use the money or not. Regardless of
whether we are philosophically ready to approve this type of
thing, which we are not, we must take advantage of it because we
are going to be paying for it anyway.  We are going to be there
with our tax money like everybody else. 

The Deputy Speaker:  The time has expired.  I would remind
the hon. member for Cariboo--Chilcotin that he is not supposed to
answer a question or put a question unless he is sitting in his
seat. 

I remind all hon. members of that.
Mr. Mayfield:  I am ware of that, Mr. Speaker.  I will try
to contain myself in future. 

Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of
Canadian Heritage):  Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I
rise today to applaud the government's decision to reinstate the
court challenges program. 

The original court challenges program began in 1978 when the
Secretary of State and the Minister of Justice announced the
establishment of a fund to provide financial assistance for legal
expenses of litigants seeking clarification of the scope of
protection afforded to official language minorities under either
section 93 or 133 of the Constitution Act of 1867. 

Following the proclamation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms
in 1982 the Secretary of State and the Minister of Justice
reaffirmed and updated the court challenges program.  The program
was expanded to include sections 16 to 23 of the Charter of
Rights and Freedoms.  In 1985 section 15 of the charter came into
effect and the court challenges program was expanded to include
equality rights protected under that provision.   At the same
time, administration of the program was assigned to an arm's
length organization, the Canadian Council on Social Development,
which administered the program until 1990 when the responsibility
was transferred to the Human Rights Research and Education Centre
of the University of Ottawa. 

The termination by the previous government of the court
challenges program was severely criticized.  It was seen by many
as an attack on human rights.  Former Supreme Court Justice
Bertha Wilson wrote to the Minister of Justice at the time,
expressing here dismay and distress over the cancellation of the
program.  She wrote, in part:  ``I have on numerous occasions
publicly expressed the view that it is totally illusory to confer
rights on people who do not have the means to enforce them''. 

The program has been commended for making the critical
difference between access to charter rights and no access, and
this government is committed to ensuring access for Canadians to
a judicial system that would otherwise be beyond reach. 

We agree with Madam Wilson that rights for people who do not
have the means to enforce them are totally illusory. 

[Translation]
The program funds precedent-making cases that are national in 
scope.  While it subsidizes individuals and groups, it is concerned with 
issues that affect many Canadians.  It is not a general legal aid 
program.  To guarantee impartiality of decisions on cases with financial 
implications, the government has transferred responsibility for the 
program to independent organizations. 

Since its founding, the program has been unique in Canada and has 
attracted praise from outside the country as well.  It bears witness to 
the fact that enshrining rights in legislation has no impact if the 
people they are supposed to protect lack the means to enforce those 
rights.  

In fact, people have been very critical of the Charter has been 
criticized because it is not accessible to the average Canadian. In the 
past, the Court Challenges Program has ensured access to the courts for 
all individuals who want to defend their language or equality rights. 

The program has made it possible for all Canadians to be full 
participants in the Constitution of our country.  It has been 
instrumental in making charter rights accessible to francophone parents, 
aboriginal women and the disabled, to name only a few.  

[English]
In addition to language and equality rights, the new court
challenges program will fund test cases of national significance
involving challenges to fundamental freedoms as outlined under
section 2 of the charter. 

[Translation]
These basic freedoms are as follows: freedom of conscience and 
religion, freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including 
freedom of the press and other media of communication, freedom of 
peaceful assembly and freedom of association.
I am also pleased to say that the program, as reinstated, will 
continue to provide financial support for justice tests that are 
national in scope and concern federal and provincial statutes covered by 
sections 93 and 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867, section 23 of the 
Manitoba Act, 1870, and sections 16 to 23 of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms. 

The program will also continue to provide financial support for 
court challenges of federal statutes, practices and policies, under 
sections 15--equality--and 28--gender equality--of the Charter, 
or when an argument relating to section 27 of the Charter-- 
multiculturalism--supports arguments based on section 15.  

The new program will be administered independently by a non-profit 
agency, whose board of directors will include representatives of the 
Canadian Bar Association, non-governmental organizations and 
universities.  

[English]
Proposals and discussion papers on the new program have been
received from a number of groups.  Officials are reviewing these
carefully as they continue to work on the modalities of the
program.  A number of parties have expressed an interest in
working with the department to ensure the expedient reinstatement
of the program. 

This government recognizes and values the experience of
individuals and groups involved with the former court challenges
program.  It is committed to seeking their views prior to making
a decision on the legal structure and operating principles of the
new program. 

As a result of the broad range of interest, experience and
expertise which will be taken into account by the government, I
am confident the program will be implemented as quickly as
possible in a manner accountable to the government and the people
of Canada. 

Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased
to rise once again on an opposition day. 

The last time I stood on an opposition day was February 21. We
were speaking on petitions.  The Reform Party was advancing the
notion it wanted this House to listen better.  It wanted to show
that we listen better to Canadians and to each other. 

Interestingly enough when my time expired one of my colleagues
on that side of the House moved a motion that the time be
extended so I could answer some questions.  Members of the Reform
Party were the ones who voted against it.  That is important for
us to note. 

In terms of dealing with this budget, one has to wonder whether
the opposition perhaps is being a little sanctimonious.  I say
that because there was an election.  We can talk all we want
about petitions or referendums, but there was an election on
October 25. 

We went to the public with a plan. It was outlined in the red
book.  We said that we were going to follow that plan if we
formed a government.  Now that we are in government that is
exactly what we are doing.  We are following that plan. For
members of a party that says it believes in petitions and
referendums to turn around and tell us we should ignore our
campaign promises to Canadians certainly is the height of
cynicism and sanctimony. 

Let us look at what was contained in the budget.  We talked
about what we would do in the fiscal framework of present day
realities.
It is in the budget that there are $5 of spending cuts for every
$1 of revenue increase.  Over 80 per cent of the net fiscal
improvements achieved by the government through 1996-97 comes
through spending cuts.  The net savings of $17 billion achieved
in spending cuts come after paying for our new initiatives. 

Some $6.7 billion in current federal program spending is being
reallocated to encourage growth, create jobs and find new
priorities.  Those same programs are criticized in this motion. 

We are talking about the infrastructure program that was the
subject of such debate in the last election.  In my riding of
Waterloo the Reform candidate ran in the previous municipal
election.  When I won the seat to represent the Waterloo federal
riding in this House, my seat on council became vacant. During
the course of the campaign the Reform candidate was saying that
the infrastructure program was pork barrelling. It was a make
work project and had no redeeming value. 

The Reform candidate now occupies my seat on Waterloo municipal
council. And guess what?  Last week they laid out the
infrastructure program for the city of Waterloo.  Waterloo is
spending all its allocation.  What happened with the Reform
candidate who spoke so strongly against it?  The Reform candidate
voted in favour of the infrastructure program.  It was unanimous.

I raise that because just like every other new Liberal member
and I am sure most other members of this House I honestly and
truly wanted to believe this Parliament was going to be
different.  We wanted to believe we would not be playing
sanctimonious games, that we would be working together to improve
the operation of this House. 

That is not the reality.  And it saddens me because every new
member on my side of the House is a small ``r'' reformer and they
are acting a lot different from the big ``R'' Reformers.  We have
to keep that in mind. 

Staying with the infrastructure program, they say it is a make
work project.  One of the infrastructure programs deals with the
inventory and repair of failing sewer lines throughout the city. 
Sewer lines are pretty important to any municipality.  As a
matter of fact, sewer lines make us a civilized country, along
with water and other infrastructure.  It is the elimination of
inflow infiltration to the sewer lines. 

Another program is to extend the Northland 4 industrial
subdivision pumping station.  There are sewers, water mains and
road construction projects.  They are doing that so they can have
new industry locate.  New industry will generate jobs and pay
taxes. 

Tell me the last time private enterprise built a sewage
treatment plant.  Clearly that is something government has to do.
 It is a responsibility belonging to government. 

Infrastructure:  Look around the world at countries that do not
have infrastructure and you are looking at countries in the Third
World.  Look at the G-7 countries and the money they spend on
infrastructure.  They are spending it because they are investing
in the future of their countries.  We are investing in the future
of our country. We as Liberals believe in that. 

Prior to the tabling of the budget many Reform members and I had
occasion to attend a workshop by the Fraser Institute. Do you
know what was said?  It was said that our proposal to get our
goal of 3 per cent of the GDP in terms of reducing the debt
within three years was a responsible approach.  It was a rational
approach.
We all knew that the deficit was going to be $32 billion this
year.  The previous regime told us that.  The reality is we are
looking at a much higher deficit this year. 

The Reform Party in the last campaign said it was going to
eliminate the deficit in three years.  What Reform members say
and how they act impacts on all of us and on the legitimacy of
this Chamber.  For the sake of their own credibility and that of
this House I would love to see them stand in this House and
present to us how they would eliminate the deficit.  I put to
this House that they could not do it.  I challenge them to stand
up--which they will not--and say they were wrong and they cannot
do it. 

One of this country's tragedies is what is happening to our
youth.  In 1992, 100,000 young people who graduated from high
school were qualified to attend college or university but there
was no place for them in our educational institutions.  Reform
Party members would chop out the youth services corps which is
meant to address the drastically and shamefully high unemployment
rate among our youth. To see their opposition to this corps has
to sadden every member who cares about those neglected youth who
are part of our constituencies. 

My friend made a very able presentation on the court challenges
program.  Since I have been in this House I have listened to
Reform members tell us they are in touch with the needs of
minority groups.  I can only say after listening to them for four
months that I find them compassionately challenged when it comes
to those issues. 

What does the residential rehabilitation assistance program
mean?  It means those seniors who are unable to make repairs to
their houses and move on to costlier institutions would be
assisted so they could stay in their homes and thus maintain
their dignity.  How anyone could oppose that is incredible. 

There is the engineering program.  The University of Waterloo in
my riding is the biggest supplier of workers to Microsoft in the
United States.  This has to be a brain drain.  We want to keep
our brightest graduates in whom we have invested so much in
Canada.  This will afford us an opportunity to do that. 

In wrapping this up, I was looking forward to this motion today
but I find it is very much challenged in terms of reality. I can
only say I am very proud of the budget and the responsible plan
we came down with in presenting that budget. 

[Translation]
The Deputy Speaker: The hon. member for Richelieu has the floor, 
very briefly please. 

[Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu): Very briefly as usual, Mr. 
Speaker. I always follow your precious advice.  

I was very surprised to hear the previous speaker, a member of the 
Liberal Party, express astonishment that a member of the Reform Party 
may have changed his mind or acted differently after an election. It is 
a distinctive feature of the Liberal Party to have two languages, one 
during the election campaign and a new, different one after the 
campaign. The most conclusive evidence is the budget tabled by the 
Minister of Finance, which is exactly the kind of budget tabled by 
former Tory ministers.  

I was surprised to hear him talk about contradictions as, when the 
Liberals were in opposition and the Conservatives dealt with 
unemployment through Bill C-113, I was also in opposition as a member of 
the Bloc Quebecois and I heard Liberal members cry out against that 
change. The last budget is doing worse things to the unemployed but they 
have not said a word. In closing, I am very surprised to see that when 
they were in opposition, they attacked the changes to old age pensions 
proposed by the Tory government, but now that they are in office, they 
do not hesitate to assail old age pensions.
I was very surprised when I heard him say that sewers are the 
solution in Canada and the distinctive characteristic of civilized 
countries. I thought it was culture, respect for young people, the right 
to work, and that it was a finance minister who made the right 
decisions. 

[English]
Mr. Telegdi:  Mr. Speaker, may I say that on Friday with a
number of my colleagues I had the opportunity to look at the
social programs in my riding.  Everyone who participated came up
with very good suggestions about our social programs and how we
have to reform them as we head into the next decade. 

Everyone who came from the baby-boom generation would have some
concern about old age pensions.  We are going to have the biggest
revolution when the baby boomers become senior citizens.
Demographically it is going to be like everything else. When the
boomers got to university, the university education system
exploded.  Therefore, we have to plan for that. 

I really regret that the Bloc Quebecois would not want to look
at this to make sure that in the future we will have a pension
system that is supportable, viable and will be there for people
in need. There has been absolutely no talk about cutting
pensions. 

In terms of sewers and infrastructure, even this Chamber has to
have sewage service, probably more than most other places.  Any
building, whether it is a university building or an industrial
building has to have a sewage system and a water system. Those
systems are very important in protecting our environment as well.

The Deputy Speaker:  The debate is over at 6.23.  I wonder
if the two members from the Reform Party want to cut into the
time of their own members, two of whom are the next speakers.
Assuming not, the next speaker is the hon. member for Simcoe
Centre. 

Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):   Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to speak against the budget and in support of our motion to do
something about the current deficit and debt that we face as a
country. 

I do not know if members have ever heard a million dollar
speech, but I am about to give one.  Members may not agree it is
worth that much, but the fact remains that by the time I
conclude, with our current debt accumulating at $78,000 per
minute, we will have slipped another million dollars into debt.
This is the ticking time bomb we are sitting on. 

Mr. O'Reilly:  That is enough to make you lose your hair. 

Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):  I cannot afford to do that. I
appreciate that this is a two part budget and nothing in the
first part will correct the problem. Given the track record on
promises for the future on the second stage I have no optimism. 

We have been living beyond our means for over 20 years and over
that same period each budget would acknowledge how serious the
problem was, yet we still overspent and the debt continued to
grow. 

In spite of this history of year after year of failed budgets we
continue to go down the same road.  Apparently no one is asking
the question:  ``What are we doing wrong?  Why have our plans not
worked''?  The problem to me is the fact that we place all of our
emphasis on those things that we have little control over;
interest payments and growth in the economy. 

The one area where we do have complete control is spending and
yet we ignore it in the hope that we can grow our way out with
optimistic growth projections and pray that interest rates will
remain low. The government has a spending problem. There is no
other variable available that we can control. 

If we are serious about eliminating our deficit and then
reducing our debt we must attack spending. 
Ano mistake about it, this is a war of Canada's survival. I
am not talking about nibbling around the edges like this budget.
I am talking about serious spending cuts, not next year or the
year after but now.
From my background in small business I know how important the
bottom line is.  If you want to stay in business and employ
people you must make a profit or at least break even. As a
manager of that business if you fail to make a profit you fail
the employees who lose their jobs.  The bottom line is profit for
people.  Government is a business, not a business for profit but
a break even business and the government is failing our people. 

You cannot lose money year after year.  You can borrow to a
point.  However, governments have gone far beyond the point of
good business sense.  Our lenders do us no favours by allowing us
to go deeper and deeper into an abyss of debt.  The pain and
suffering that will come will not be any easier as we delay the
inevitable as the budget does. 

During the first few days of the 35th Parliament I heard the
phrase ``lean but not mean'' many times. In some ways those are
meaningless words of comfort.  You cannot be lean but not mean. 
You are speaking with a forked tongue.  To those who are going to
be affected by your decisions to cut or reduce you are mean.  To
the 16,000 military personnel in the defence cuts plus the
thousands of jobs lost in the cancellation of the EH-101 contract
without debating the merits of those decisions, you were mean. 

Unfortunately due to excessive spending by former governments
there is no painless way out of the current mess.  The budget has
only delayed the day and continues to play a cruel hoax on
Canadians by pretending there is an easy way out.  There is not.
We have 20 years of history to prove it. 

It is ironic that on the first day of this Parliament the
federal budget reached half a trillion dollars, a national
disgrace for a country of 27 million people, a personal debt of
$74,000 for each family of four living in the country, $18,000 of
debt for every man, woman and child. 

As shocking as these numbers are, the government is prepared to
add almost $40 billion this year toward an additional $100
billion over the next three years to a total of $600 billion or
$22,000 per person by 1996. It is madness.  We cannot afford the
programs we have and yet we are prepared to add more. 

The 35th Parliament set three targets.  The first is the largest
deficit in our history, the largest number of new members, and
the largest debt ever. What a great opportunity with so many new
faces with fresh ideas to turn this place around and leave it in
four years a better place than we found it, fiscally responsible
and economically sound. 

In 22 years of Liberal governments the debt soared from about
$25 billion to $180 billion with an absolute freefall starting in
1975-1976.  After losing to the Conservatives in 1984 the debt
plunged to a record $500 billion in 1993, almost triple in nine
short years. This in spite of the fact that each and every budget
announced the intention of attacking the deficit and the debt. 

Where is the credibility?  We have had 20 years of failed
budgets, 20 years of broken promises, 20 years of tax increases,
and 20 years of declining services.  Is there any wonder that
Canadians have lost faith in their politicians? 

There is a frightening similarity between overfishing and
overspending.  For years we were warned that our fish stocks were
in danger and that continued fishing at current rates would
deplete our them, costing thousands of jobs.  We ignored that
advice at our peril. We have the same scenario today in out of
control government spending.  We have been warned it cannot
continue yet we ignore the warnings.
With our situation deteriorating by the minute as it has done
for the past 20 years no one is asking why.  What are we doing
wrong? How do we stop this addiction to spending?  Like drugs or
alcohol in many ways it is an addiction.  Like an addiction the
first step toward a cure is acknowledgement that we have a
problem. 

This budget fails that test.  Much worse, it says very clearly
that our finance minister does not understand. 

Unless we face and solve these problems now nothing else
matters, not health care, not education and not our ability to
compete. 

The headline on the cover of this week's Maclean's
magazine asks the question:  ``Are we cheating our kids?''  While
the story deals with education, the same question applies to this
generation's overspending and the terrible debt load we are
leaving their young shoulders. 

The reason I am here today is my deep concern for my children
and my grandchildren.  I am ashamed of my part in this spending
binge that has mortgaged their future.  Sitting back was not good
enough.  I had to get involved and do what I could to save their
future, and in saving their future we would be saving Canada from
the terrible prospects of bankruptcy. 

Some politicians will say that deficit and debt are a problem
but not to worry.  Those politicians are burying their heads in
the sand.  We have been told for 20 years that things are going
to get better, yet our situation has never been worse. 

In the next three years we will add $100 billion more debt and
we will still be overspending by $25 billion. 

For 20 years I ran a small business in Barrie providing
employment for some 20 people.  Each month and each year I
worried that we would maintain a profit or at least break even so
I could protect their jobs and mine.  It is no different from any
other business, large or small.  It is no different than the
taxpayers across this great country making ends meet, living
within their means. 

Why is it that governments think they can do otherwise?  A big
part of the answer is the fact that governments have been able to
come back to us for more taxes, never cutting spending, just
increasing taxes.  The day of tax increases being productive is
over. 

My constituents told me very clearly they have no more to give.
Any further attempts at a tax grab would ignite a tax revolt.
Many of our citizens have expressed their disgust in past
increases and broken promises by joining the underground economy
which is costing honest taxpayers billions of dollars. 

As part of our zero in three plan we outlined a savings of $500
million in subsidies to special interest groups that have been
living off all taxpayers when they should have been getting
funding from those they supposedly represent.  We are doing a
further study on this issue. 

Governments do not create jobs.  The private sector does.  The
$6 billion infrastructure program outlined in the budget to kick
start our economy was described by Sir Roger Douglas, former
finance minister of New Zealand, as taking a feather duster to
the Eiffel Tower.  Those few jobs will disappear after the
funding runs out and we will be a further $6 billion in debt. 

The private sector will create the long term jobs our children
and grandchildren need.  The private sector is not looking for
government handouts.  It is looking for governments to get off of
its back and out of its pockets and out of the pockets of its
customers. 

The reduction in UI premiums is a step in the right direction
and I applaud the government for that. 

In closing, let me say that all of the problems we face are pale
by comparison.  If we fail to attack this overspending, this
mortgaging our children's future, we will fail Canada.  We are
facing a battle that is greater than any our country has faced
before.  Working together we can make the tough decisions to
bring back fiscal responsibility. 

This budget is not the answer.  We cannot delay.  We can pay now
or we can pay much more dearly later. 

[Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North):  Mr. speaker,
the speech was not worth a million dollars to me.  He asked for
$1 million. 

On this motion paragraph (a) asks for a cut in the budget for
the youth service corps, the court challenges program, the
residential rehabilitation assistance plan, the engineering plan
program and infrastructure.  That is one paragraph.
Paragraph (c) says that we should spend money to produce
quarterly reports.  We are going to spend money to produce
reports but we will not spend money to create jobs. How does one
explain this in the motion? 

Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):  Mr. Speaker, item (c) where
we are asking that money be spent on quarterly reports on our
progress ties in very nicely with a recommendation that was made
in the Auditor General's report. 

One problem we have faced over the years is that the Canadian
public is not being kept aware of the magnitude of this program
and our progress or lack of progress in solving it.  Our
reference to that is for information, to keep this Parliament and
all Canadians aware of the progress that we are making toward
attacking the deficit and the debt. 

I do not think that is wasted money.  It is money well spent. We
will be keeping in touch with our progress in addressing this
most serious concern that we face and indeed that all Canadians
are going to be affected by. 

Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley--Lloydminster):  Mr.
Speaker, I realize the time is short and I will not be able to
give the entire load that I intended to deliver to the House on
this occasion in speaking in support of our motion put forward by
my colleague, the hon. member for Lethbridge. 

I had intended to relate to this House the effect that I felt
the federal government's budget would have on the agricultural
industry.  Perhaps when another day provides the opportunity I
will be able to give this presentation in a little bit more
detail. 

I would like to make a few points in the short time that I have
available, especially in light of the fact that the Minister of
Agriculture is in the House.  It would have been a great pleasure
and a privilege to discuss agriculture at quite some length
because agriculture has been an issue that has strangely been on
the back burner.  It has received very little attention in the
House from the government side. 

I know that my constituents in Kindersley--Lloydminster and
Canadians in rural areas are quite concerned that the government
does not have a handle on federal spending.  Federal agriculture
programs are not only in jeopardy but our very standard of living
is in jeopardy and will affect all communities in this country as
well as agriculture. 

By not taking the necessary steps to deal with the deficit now
the government is sacrificing the future of government services
to all Canadians, including people in the agricultural field.
Rather than taking these essential steps the government has
decided to create more spending programs. 

We would encourage the government to place a moratorium on new
spending, including the new spending requirements announced in the
budget namely, and we have talked about them today, the youth
service corps, the court challenges program and the engineer's
program but particularly the infrastructure program. 

I was quite saddened to hear comments made by the Minister of
Public Works mocking Reform's position that Canadians are not as
excited about the infrastructure program as the government would
have us believe. 

The minister challenged members on this side of the House to
have their constituencies refuse infrastructure funding.  It
seemed like a very unfair request to make in that constituents
who are represented by Reform MPs are being raped and pillaged by
high taxes and then are expected to give up the morsels that the
government would offer by way of inadequate infrastructure
programs. 

More seriously, what is really the heart of the matter is that
instead of having a few new programs, what is really going to
happen is that we are not going to have security for the programs
that Canadians rely upon including federal support for health
care for those seniors that the government side seems to be so
concerned about, if they have a few programs that have nice
frills around the edges.  However we lose the core of our health
care program.  What good are these programs? 

If we have a youth corps program but we do not have quality
education for our young people in this country, of what value is
a youth corps program? 
Finally, if our seniors lose their old age security pensions and
low income assistance, of what value are some of these frills
that the government would put forward in the way of new programs?

Reformers have been talking about priorities.  We have been
talking about what is really important to keep this great country
of ours together with a high standard of living that we can all
be proud of.  Whether we are people in the private sector who are
small business people, farmers, whether we are seniors who have
committed a great deal of effort and energy into making this a
great country, or whether we are the youth of this country who
would like to think they have a bright future where they can
contribute to a great land and to a society that they can make
better, I and many Canadians are concerned that this will not be
the case in light of the fact that the government has not been
able to control its spending.  In fact, this debt may be a
ticking time bomb that will explode on future generations and
deny them the standard of living and the lifestyle that we have
enjoyed as Canadians who have lived beyond our means.  They will
not have that same opportunity. 

Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the short time you have allowed me
to speak.  As I mentioned, perhaps I will be able to unload the
entire load at some future occasion.
