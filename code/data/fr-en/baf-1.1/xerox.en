What ScanWorX Can Do.

The ScanWorX system is designed for high-volume scanning of a wide
range of documents (Figure 1-3).

Figure 1-3. Document examples.

The system enables you to perform a variety of document processing
tasks. Specifically, you can:.

scan, recognize, and format text and images from a variety of
single-sided or double-sided documents with different page sizes,
orientations, and print sources (see Chapter 4).

Text can be converted to FrameMaker (version 1.0 and above), Interleaf
(version 4.0 and above), several Text-only (ASCII) formats, or KDOC
for CALS and other third-party conversions. Text can also be stored in
a ScanWorX internal format, Format Analyzed Text, for later job
resumption or multiple conversions.

Original artwork can be captured as line art (straight
black-and-white) or as dithered halftone images and output to TIFF
Uncompressed, TIFF CCITT-3, TIFF CCITT-4, Sun Rasterfile Standard, Sun
Rasterfile Encoded, and Interleaf Graphics Format (IGF).

delay processing by storing page images in TIFF files, then perform
recognition at off-peak hours (see Chapter 5).

accurately recognize even low-quality documents by verifying the text
as it is being recognized (see Chapter 6).

preview and zone pages to precisely identify the text and graphics to
be recognized (see Chapter 7).

ScanWorX features Xerox Imaging Systems' exclusive Intelligent
Character Recognition (ICR) software. Using artificial intelligence
techniques, ICR provides unsurpassed character recognition accuracy of
virtually any document. These include documents produced on
typewriters, dot-matrix printers, ink-jet printers, laser printers,
and phototypesetters, as well as photocopied versions of any of these
document types.

In addition, ScanWorX offers powerful text verification features which
enable you to optimize character recognition for difficult documents
(Figure 1-4).

ScanWorX User's Guide.

How the System Works.

ScanWorX User's Guide.

When you use ScanWorX, you generally need to complete only a few
simple steps to initiate a complex task.

The system does the difficult work - scanning documents, recognizing
text and image data, and converting the data to useable file formats.

From scanned pages, the system recognizes characters and words,
character style (roman, italic, bold, underline), and text formatting
details such as line position and tabs.

At your direction, the system also recognizes graphic images from
scanned pages.

After it isolates and recognizes text and graphics, the system
converts recognized data to the format of your choice and outputs the
formatted data to text and graphics files on your hard disk.

Before you begin using the system, it may be helpful for you to review
some of the basics of system operation. This chapter introduces you to
concepts about system design and operation that will help you
understand and effectively use the system.

Specifically, these topics are presented:.

Starting the system.

Main window.

Menu selection methods.

File types in the system.

How ScanWorX processes pages.

Loading pages in the ScanWorX scanner.

Starting the System.

After your system administrator has installed ScanWorX on your
workstation, you can begin a work session by typing the ScanWorX
command in a shell window on your OPEN LOOK desktop:.

icr .

Note.

You must launch ScanWorX from within OPEN LOOK. Otherwise, your Sun
system will generate a bus error.

ScanWorX responds by displaying a splash window introducing the system
(Figure 2-1).

Figure 2-1. Splash window.

Main Window.

The main window (Figure 2-2) is the control center for all ScanWorX
functions. Items in the main window are presented in four general
categories.

How the System Works.

The Input Source category defines the origin of pages to be processed
- the scanner or TIFF files loaded on the TIFF Queue.

The Process category defines what type of data is to be output during
the job to files on your Sun system - text, image, or both.

The Options category indicates the interactive tools that you will be
using to assist ScanWorX. Previewing and text verification tools are
available.

The Settings category provides access to subwindows that let you
define job settings, save and load settings files, and save and
restore default settings.

Figure 2-2. Main window.

Methods for Using ScanWorX.

ScanWorX is designed to use OPEN LOOK conventions. Therefore, if you
are familiar with other OPEN LOOK applications, you should quickly
become familiar with ScanWorX operation.

Mostly you will use a mouse to operate ScanWorX. However, the system
also provides some keyboard equivalents and a command line interface.

Use the mouse.

Generally, if you have had experience with graphical user interfaces,
you are probably accustomed to using a mouse to operate applications
(Figure 2-3).

Figure 2-3. Using the mouse.

Using a mouse plugged into your workstation, you can quickly "point
and click" to select ScanWorX commands, checkbox options, and on/off
buttons in menus.

For virtually all operations in ScanWorX, use the left mouse button.
The right mouse button lets you access pop-up menus for cycle options
in ScanWorX windows.

For more information about the three buttons on your mouse, see the
appropriate Sun Microsystems documentation.

Use the keyboard.

In general, ScanWorX does not provide a keyboard interface to menu
options.

However, some key equivalents are available when you use the Verifier
toolbox, described fully in Chapter 6, "Verifying Text.".

Use the command line interface.

ScanWorX provides access via a command line interface. The command
line interface is a separate executable.

You can also use the command line interface to start ScanWorX from
another program or script.

If you do use the command line interface in a OPEN LOOK shell window,
you should also make sure to have a OPEN LOOK console window open, as
well, to view any console messages that may occur.

See Chapter 8, "Tips and Techniques" for more information about the
command line interface.

File Types in the System.

ScanWorX introduces a number of file types that are specific to its
recognition and document processing environment.

Table 2-1 (next page) lists and briefly describes these file types and
the file extensions that are used to identify them.

Files that have been created due to an interruption are removed from
the system when you resume document processing and then end the
interruption of the document.

Table 2-1. File Types in the System;.

File Type, Ext., Description.

Interleaf, .doc, Text files in Interleaf ASCII format.

FrameMaker, .mif, Text files in Frames Maker Interchange Format (MIF).

, .@tf, Temporary unconverted document file.

, .@tq, Temporary TIFF Queue file.

, .@tt, Temporary template file.

How ScanWorX Processes Pages.

ScanWorX requires input from the scanner or TIFF queue to produce
output in the form of text and/or graphic image files.

When a hard copy document page, monochrome or color illustration, or
photograph is scanned or read from a TIFF file, ScanWorX stores the
page image in computer memory as a binary (black-and-white) picture.
These electronic pictures are sometimes called bitmap images (Figure
2-4).

Figure 2-4. Bitmap images.

Normally, you use your scanner to produce page images. However, the
system also accepts page images from TIFF files, which may come from
multiple sources, including ScanWorX. TIFF, which stands for Tag Image
File Format, is an industry-standard image format.

When the system gets a page image from the scanner or a TIFF file, it
can treat incoming data in one of several ways:.

Perform character recognition and save the recognized text in an
unconverted document file. You can later convert this text to any of
the formats supported by the system.

Perform character recognition and immediately end and convert the text
to a chosen format.

Process the page and save the output as a TIFF image file for later
processing.

Process the page and save the output as an image.

Process the page and save the output as both text and image.

Character recognition.

ScanWorX accomplishes unparalleled character recognition accuracy by
using proprietary artificial intelligence techniques known as
Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR).

ICR enables the system to provide true omnifont character recognition,
capable of reading thousands of type styles in sizes from 6- to
24-point on both portrait and landscape pages.

The system recognizes typeset, laser-printed, impact-printed,
typewritten, and dot matrix print, and distinguishes roman, italic,
bold, underlined, subscripted and superscripted type.

Intelligent character recognition learns about type styles and
character forms present in the document, and adapts and tunes its
recognition capabilities for best results.

Thus, page recognition actually gets more accurate, and considerably
faster, as ScanWorX becomes more familiar with the number of
characters recognized and learned.

During processing, the system employs cooperating recognition experts,
artificial intelligence components that contribute to the analysis and
recognition of characters and words.

These recognition experts work on three separate levels. At the lowest
level, text and graphics are distinguished, and individual words on
the page are identified.

Recognition experts decide whether a mark is noise or a character to
be retained for further analysis, and analyze the size, shape,
alignment and complexity of image fragments. Gutters and lines are
examined to determine column boundaries.

At the next level, recognition experts analyze character shapes,
touching characters, and fragmented characters.

In addition, they correlate new images with data collected from
earlier images to help with recognition of poorly printed text.

Third-level experts work to resolve ambiguities still present in text,
for example, using an integrated dictionary with built-in context
rules to decide the identity of similarly-shaped characters (Figure
2-5).

Figure 2-5. Similarly-shaped characters.

For jobs that contain a great deal of technical terminology, such as
scientific reports and product specifications, the system also lets
you prepare and load a user dictionary.

A user dictionary is a word file that you create, containing up to
10,000 special terms. The system employs a user dictionary as an
extension of the built-in dictionary to improve text recognition.

See Chapter 8, "Tips and Techniques," for more information about
preparing a user dictionary.

Flagging recognition errors.

Because no text recognition software can be 100-percent accurate all
the time, the system lets you define special markers that can be
output to the text file to flag recognition errors (Figure 2-6).

Figure 2-6. Questionable and illegible character flags.

One marker is for questionable characters, characters that ScanWorX is
unsure about (even though they may be correctly recognized). Another
marker is for illegible characters, characters that ScanWorX is unable
to recognize.

After your text file is created, you can edit it and search for these
recognition flags, and make corrections as necessary.

Text formatting.

While accuracy is very important in text recognition, it is only part
of the equation. Of equal importance is text formatting (Figure 2-7).

The system recognizes the scanned pages and preserves many of the
formatting and style characteristics of the original document. It then
translates it to a file format that you can work with right away, such
as Interleaf or FrameMaker.

Figure 2-7. From hard copy to formatted text file.

Delayed processing.

As Figure 2-7 illustrates, you can also output scanned pages to TIFF
image files.

ScanWorX supports TIFF output as part of a delayed processing strategy
that lets you take full advantage of your equipment.

The system processes the image of a page into a binary TIFF file
considerably faster than actually performing character recognition -
the most time-consuming part of capturing documents.

Thus, during the day you can quickly scan multiple pages as TIFF
files, monitoring the scanning process and reloading the automatic
document feeder as necessary.

Then, at off-peak hours - such as overnight or during your lunch break
- you can instruct the system to convert and format the text and
images from the TIFF files. When you return, you can immediately begin
editing or otherwise processing the converted files.

For complete information about delayed processing, refer to Chapter 5.

Image processing.

When you scan a drawing or photograph, your scanner can create a
bitmap image of the graphic, as it does for text. ScanWorX, at your
instruction, can output this bitmap image as a straight
black-and-white (binary) image.

Alternatively, ScanWorX can process the image as a dithered halftone
image. As with text, image data can be processed to the image format
that you select (Figure 2-8).

Figure 2-8. From hard copy to formatted image file.

See Chapter 4 for basic instructions to scan images. Refer to Chapter
7 for information about using zoning tools to capture images from
previewed pages. See Chapter 8 for information about getting the best
image quality.

Loading Pages into the Scanner.

The ScanWorX scanner is a 400 dpi (dots per inch) flatbed scanner with
an attached automatic document feeder (ADF).

Thus, you can place pages one-by-one on the flatbed and scan them, or
for volume processing, you can use the ADF, which has a capacity of 50
pages.

For most jobs, it is easiest to use the ADF. You simply load a stack
of pages in the ADF, specify Use Automatic Document Feeder in the
ScanWorX Scanner Settings window, and start the job. ScanWorX
processes all the pages in the ADF automatically.

When you are scanning a photograph or line drawing, however, you may
want to place the image directly on the scanner flatbed. Scanning
images via the ADF can result in a slightly skewed (slanted) image,
which may not be acceptable to you.

Also, you should use the flatbed to scan images that are on paper
stock that is too heavy (or too delicate) to feed through the ADF.

Use the ADF.

The ADF lets you scan pages as wide as 11.8 inches (30 cm) and as long
as approximately 17 inches (43 cm).

Figure 2-9. Portrait pages in the ADF.

When you load a stack of pages that have a portrait orientation (print
running across the width of the paper), place them face down with the
page tops entering the scanner first (Figure 2-9).

When you load a stack of pages that have a landscape orientation
(print running lengthwise across the paper), place them face down with
page tops along the left edge (Figure 2-10).

Figure 2-10. Landscape pages in the ADF.

When you scan in landscape mode, you need to inform ScanWorX of this
by specifying Landscape orientation in the Document Settings window.

Use the flatbed.

ScanWorX lets you use the full platen size when scanning pages on the
flatbed. The platen is 11.7 inches (29.7 cm) by 16.5 inches (75.4 cm).

For most office documents (8.5-by-11 inches), the platen is large
enough so you can scan pages in portrait mode, regardless of whether
they are printed in portrait or landscape orientation.

When placing pages on the flatbed, use the triangular registration
mark as a guide.

For portrait pages, place the page face down with the top of the page
against the ruler edge and centered on the registration mark (Figure
2-11).

Figure 2-11. Portrait page on the flatbed.

For landscape pages, place the page face down with the side of the
page centered on the registration mark (Figure 2-12).

Figure 2-12. Landscape page on the flatbed.

Caution.

Before scanning, close the cover as the scanning light source is quite
bright.

Zones, Zone marker: lets you specify character(s) to flag the start of
a zone (column) in the output file.

, Zone Position: lets you specify zone coordinate information in the
output file (see Chapter 8,, "Tips and Techniques" for more
information)

Preserve, Lets you specify preservation of italic,, bold,,
underlines,, font changes,, page breaks,, and subscripts and
superscripts.

, Note	Preserve options are available only for Interleaf and
FrameMaker formats.

Resume

One very important ScanWorX feature is the capability to interrupt and
resume a document.

For example, you might want to interrupt processing of a document in
order to scan and recognize a higher-priority job.

When you reach a convenient stopping point, you can interrupt a job
and save the partial document and associated files. Then you can begin
and complete the higher-priority job.

The Resume command allows you to resume an interrupted job. Resume
displays a window to select the filename and directory of the
interrupted document.

You can interrupt a document only after the first page of the job has
been processed.

For complete information about interrupting and resuming a job, see
Chapter 8.

Pause

The Pause command lets you suspend processing of the current document
and make decisions about how you want to continue. For example, you
could pause a job, change settings, then continue the job. When you
click the Pause button, a window with six options is displayed (Figure
3-5).

Figure 3-5. Pause window

From the Pause window, you can continue the job, preview the current
page, interrupt the job, end the document, cancel the page, or cancel
the entire document.

The Pause command is dimmed in the main window if the preview window
is open. The preview window contains pause options at the top of the
window.

Convert

The Convert command lets you convert a Format Analyzed Text
(unconverted) file to one of the other supported text formats -
Interleaf, FrameMaker, or one of several ASCII file types.

The advantage of storing recognized text as Format Analyzed Text is
that you can later convert the document to multiple file formats. Your
unconverted .@dc and .@fa files remain intact.

For example, you can convert a Format Analyzed Text document to
FrameMaker or Interleaf format for desktop publishing, while also
converting it to ASCII for data base purposes.

For complete information about text conversion, see Chapter 8.

Input Source

The Input Source option allows you to select the origin of page images
that are to be processed during a job. Three options appear in the
Input Source category:

Scanner

TIFF

TIFF Queue

Scanner

Select the Scanner button to specify that ScanWorX is to process pages
coming in from the attached scanner.

TIFF

Select the TIFF button to specify that ScanWorX is to process page
images stored in TIFF files that are loaded on the TIFF Queue.

When you select TIFF, observe that the TIFF Queue command is undimmed
(now available).

TIFF Queue

If you specify TIFF as the Input Source, ScanWorX looks to the TIFF
Queue for TIFF files to process.

Click the TIFF Queue command to display the TIFF Queue Manager, which
lets you specify the TIFF files to be processed and the order in which
they should be processed (Figure 3-6, next page).

You can change the current directory and list the TIFF files in that
directory by entering a new pathname and clicking the Show Files
button.

If you are processing a group of TIFF files, ScanWorX automatically
treats the group of TIFF files as a document and reads them in the
specified order from the TIFF Queue. Thus, you can think of TIFF files
in the queue exactly as you would a stack of pages in your scanner's
automatic document feeder (ADF).

The TIFF Queue command lets you view and edit the `stack' of TIFF
files to be recognized.

Figure 3-6. TIFF Queue Manager

The TIFF Queue Manager options are described in the following
subsections.

Done

Click the Done command when you are finished adding and removing files
to the TIFF Queue.

Cancel

Click the Cancel command when you want to close, and cancel any
changes you have made to, the TIFF Queue Manager.

Show Files

Click the Show Files command to list the TIFF files in the current
directory. You can change the directory by entering a new path in
Directory field, then click on Show Files again. In this way you can
select TIFF files from any directory on your system to add to the
queue.

Add

Use the Add command to add files to the TIFF queue. In the Files list,
highlight the files to be added, then click the Add command. Added
files are displayed with their full pathnames.

Remove

Use the Remove command to remove files from the TIFF Queue. Click and
highlight any file in the queue, then click Remove.

Remove All

Use the Remove All command to remove all files from the TIFF Queue
Manager Contents box.

Select All

Use the Select All command to highlight and select all the files in
the Files list. Then you can use the Add command to add all files in
the directory to the queue.

Deselect All

Use the Deselect All command to deselect all highlighted files in the
Files list.

Process Options

Just as the Input Source category lets you define the origin of the
document to be processed, the Process category lets you define the
type of data to be captured from the document.

The Process category lets you specify that text, images, or both are
to be captured from the scanned pages (or TIFF files in the TIFF
Queue).

Text

Click the Text button to specify that only the text of scanned pages
(or TIFF files in the TIFF Queue) is to be processed.

If there are any line art or halftone images on the scanned pages,
ScanWorX will detect and ignore them.

If your document contains halftones, you can also select the Remove
Halftones filter to speed up text recognition. See the `Settings'
section later in this chapter for information.

Image

Click the Image button to specify that only image data from scanned
pages (or TIFF files in the TIFF Queue) is to be processed.

A `picture' of each page will be stored in a separate image file in
the specified image format.

Both

Click the Both button to specify that both the text of the document
and the images will be processed. This is sometimes referred to as
compound scanning.

For example, you might want to recognize the text of a document and
process it to, say, Interleaf for desktop publishing purposes.

At the same time, you might want to maintain page images of the
document on the system for data base imaging purposes.

Note

With compound scanning, you can process text and image data only as
Text or Line Art (binary).

Options Windows and Commands

In the main window, the Options category provides three checkbox
options and two commands. These five items provide access to the
system's previewing, text verification, and feedback tools, which let
you interact with, and precisely control, system processes.

If you choose the Preview mode, the Preview window is displayed. The
Preview window lets you view the scanned image and create zones after
it has been scanned from the scanner or TIFF queue and before it is
processed.

If you select the Verify mode, ScanWorX displays the Verifier window
and toolbox. These features allow you to verify and, if necessary,
correct scanned data character by character. By doing this for the
first page or two of the document, you help the system improve its
recognition accuracy for the entire document. This is especially
useful for difficult documents such as multiple-generation
photocopies.

If you select the Feedback mode, ScanWorX displays the feedback window
that provides an ongoing visual representation of the recognition
process. You can display any combination of the Preview, Verify, and
Feedback windows.

After you perform previewing and verification tasks, you can save your
work in template files and verification data files. The Load Template
and Load Verification Data commands let you reuse this data on other
documents of the same types to automate and speed up processing.

Preview

Click the Preview checkbox to open the Document Preview window (Figure
3-7, next page). The preview window enables you to view scanned pages
to ensure that they were correctly scanned.

With preview tools, which appear at the top of the window, you can
also draw text zones, image zones, and/or ignore zones.

Zones let you more precisely control the parts of the page(s) that are
to be processed, and the type(s) of data to be processed. You can
identify up to a total of 40 zones on the previewed page, in any
combination of text, image, and ignore zones.

Figure 3-7. Document Preview window

While the preview window is open, you can access most other ScanWorX
windows. So, for example, if the image in the preview window was too
dark or too light, or if the page is skewed, you can make adjustments
and rescan the page before processing it.

In addition, at the top of the preview window, you can access a number
of commands to operate the system. These commands are summarized in
Table 3-2.

For complete information about previewing documents, see Chapter 7.

Table 3-2. Document Preview Window Commands

Command, Function

Process, Recognizes (processes) the current page.

Scan Page, Scans the first (next) page in the scanner,, or TIFF file
on the TIFF queue,, and displays the page image in the preview window.
If it is the first page of a multi-page document,, the Start
Processing window appears so you can name the document before
proceeding.

Interrupt, Interrupts the job,, and saves all the intermediate
character recognition and format analysis files for pages of the
document that have been recognized so far. You can resume processing
of this document at a later time.

Cancel Page, Cancels processing of the current page and clears the
preview window.

End Document, Converts all pages of the document that have been
recognized so far,, creates the selected output files,, and closes the
window.

Cancel Document, Cancels processing of this document,, removes all
temporary files,, and clears the document preview window.

Load Template, Allows you to select and load a previously created
template file.

Save Template, Saves the current template in a template file of the
name you assign.

Clear Template, Erases all zones and links in the preview window.

in & cm, Allows you to choose between inches and centimeters in the
ruler.

Dim Image, De-emphasizes (`grays out') the page image so you can see
zones more clearly.

Verify

Certain documents have characteristics that cause character
recognition accuracy to decline, for example:

documents with noise

documents that are too dark or too light

multiple-generation photocopies

documents with ornate, thin-stroke typefaces, in which character
segments do not always connect

To enable the best possible character recognition, even on such
problem documents, ScanWorX provides an interactive text verification
system called the Text Verifier. The Text Verifier allows you to
create verification data, verify recognized text, and to correct
recognition errors.

Click the Verify box in the main window to display the Verifier window
and toolbox (Figure 3-8).

Figure 3-8. Verifier window and toolbox

The Verifier window shows a graphic display of the scanned text, and a
text display showing the recognized text.

The toolbox contains the tools you need to perform verification tasks.
Toolbox tools are briefly summarized in Table 3-3.

Table 3-3. Verifier Toolbox Tools

Tool, Key, Function

, R8, Ignore this character,, as it is simply noise on the page.

, R9, Undo any operations to the previous entire group (usually a
word,, or a word with punctuation).

, R10, Move the cursor left one character within the block. Cursor is
now in overstrike mode

, R11, Accept the character with verification. This informs ICR that
it has correctly recognized the character.

, R12, Move the cursor right one character within the block. Cursor is
now in overstrike mode,, and anything you type replaces the one
character.

, R13, Join this character (or group of characters) with the previous
character. Cursor is now in overstrike mode,, and anything typed
replaces the joined characters.

, R14, Accept the entire group with verification.

, R15, Join this character (or character group) with the next
character. Cursor is now in overstrike mode,, and anything typed
replaces the joined characters.

Feedback

To gain a visual representation of the recognition process, click on
the Feedback checkbox in the main window. This opens the Feedback
window (Figure 3-9).

Figure 3-9. Feedback window

The Feedback window displays an image of the page currently being
recognized. As the character recognition process takes place, it is
dynamically illustrated in this window.

ScanWorX employs Xerox Imaging Systems' exclusive Intelligent
Character Recognition (ICR) software, which uses artificial
intelligence techniques to teach itself about, and recognize, the
letter forms of practically any document. As outlined in Chapter 2,
ICR performs multiple passes on a page to achieve a high degree of
recognition accuracy.

This is shown in the Feedback window, as words that are not recognized
during the first recognition pass are marked (outlined) so that the
recognition software can return to them in a later pass. As text is
recognized, it is changed by ScanWorX to a generic recognition font. A
black highlight moves through the page, highlighting each word as the
word is being recognized.

If the Feedback window is sized during a process, the window contents
are scrolled (if it is made smaller) and subsequent pages are scaled
to fit the entire page into the window.

Load Template

The Load Template command allows you to load a previously created
template (.@tm) file. A template file contains a set of zones (and
links) that you defined in the preview window. When you click Load
Template in the main window, a subwindow opens, letting you locate and
load the template file (Figure 3-10).Load Template command

Figure 3-10. Load Template window

Saving and reusing template files can help to streamline your document
processing environment. For example, suppose you regularly scan a
three-column newsletter. You can create a zone template for the three
columns, and save it in a template file. Later, when you scan another
newsletter, you can load the template file. This saves you from having
to create the template each time you process this type of document.

You use the Save Template command in the preview window to store a
template in a named file. For complete information about saving and
loading template files, see Chapter 7.

Load Verification Data

When ScanWorX recognizes a document, it compiles recognition
information about the document called verification data.

When you use the Verifier, you help the ScanWorX compile extremely
accurate verification data for a particular document. This information
can be saved in a named verification data (.@cs) file and reloaded for
use with other documents of the same general type.

Thus, the time you spend optimizing character recognition for one
document can be applied over and over again to documents of the same
type. The Load Verification Data command allows you to load a
previously created verification data file. When you select the
command, the Load verification data window is displayed (Figure 3-11).

Figure 3-11. Load verification data window

In the Directory field, type the directory that contains the
verification data file. Then select Show Files to display a list of
available files in the bottom portion of the window.

Click the file to enter it in the Filename field. Then click Load to
load the file.

Important

Verification data files should be reused only for documents that are
of the same type as the document for which the original verification
data was created. Documents should be similar in design and should use
the same type styles and type sizes. Otherwise, recognition may not
improve, and in some cases, may suffer.

For complete information about the Verifier, see Chapter 6.

Settings Commands

The Settings category of commands in the main window is your control
center for preparing ScanWorX for a particular job.

The Settings category contains six commands that enable you to specify
nearly all of the job settings necessary to process even the most
complex document or graphic image.

With one of the Settings commands, you can specify document settings,
such as the number of columns in the document, the page size, and the
primary type of text in the document (alphanumeric, letters only, or
numbers only).

In addition, you can specify scanner settings to control such things
as brightness, document quality, resolution, and more.

Two commands in the Settings category let you save and reload settings
files to streamline job operation.

Finally, two Settings commands let you save settings as defaults or to
restore the preset defaults in place when you first installed the
ScanWorX system.

The following subsections describe the commands available in the
Settings category.

Document

Document settings let you inform ScanWorX about the document you
intend to process.

When you click the Document command in the main window, a window of
settings appears (Figure 3-12).

Figure 3-12. Document Settings window

Often you can scan a document without changing the default settings.
Default settings are configured for processing good quality,
letter-sized, single-column documents with a portrait orientation.
However, to more closely define the type of document you want to
process, you can change document settings.

Document settings are organized in two categories - Page Settings and
Recognition Settings.

Page Settings enable you to describe the pages that the system is
about to process. These settings include Orientation, Page Size,
Columns, Next Page, Pages, and Blank Pages Separate Documents.

Recognition Settings enable you to describe the text that system is
about to recognize. These settings include Text Type, Lexical Context,
Filtering, Confidence Level, User Dictionary, Choose User Dictionary,
and Choose Language.

All Document settings are described in the following subsections.

When you are done specifying Document Settings, click the Done button
to put them in place for the upcoming job.

Orientation

The Orientation option lets you define the orientation of print on the
page (Figure 3-13). You can select either Portrait or Landscape. The
default is Portrait.

Figure 3-13. Page orientations

ScanWorX is capable of processing documents that have a mix of
portrait and landscape pages.

If you intend to process mixed documents, you must reset Orientation
before a page with a different orientation is scanned. You may
therefore find it easiest to work with the preview window open so you
can process pages one at a time.

Page Size

The Page Size category provides selections that enable you to specify
the size of pages about to be processed. A cycle or list box lets you
select one of the standard sizes supported by the system:

Letter (8.5-by-11 inches or 21.59-by-27.94 centimeters)

Legal (8.5-by-14 inches or 21.59-by-35.56 centimeters)

A3 (11.69 -by-16.53 inches or 29.7-by-42 centimeters)

A4 (8.27-by-11.69 inches or 21-by-29.70 centimeters)

Columns

ScanWorX supports column recognition for pages with multiple columns,
including pages with irregular layouts.

Identifying where columns begin and end automatically, ScanWorX
processes the text in the correct sequence and outputs it to a file in
galley (single-column) format.

Column settings depend on page layout. An annual report, for example,
might be presented in a two- or three-column layout, where columns are
of equal width.

Newsletters, on the other hand, often have irregular layouts, where a
page might have one article set in a single four-inch column while
another is set in three two-inch columns.

Figure 3-14 provides examples of both types of layout.

Figure 3-14. Column settings and page layout

The Columns setting lets you specify that your original document has
1, 2, 3, or 4 columns.

Alternatively, you can choose Auto Detect (automatic detection) mode
for pages with complex layouts, or layouts that differ from page to
page of your document.

The default is 1 Column.

In general, specify an explicit number of columns for pages that have
symmetrical columns of equal width.

Click Auto Detect when you are scanning a page with an irregular
layout, or one that has more than four columns.

Note

Column settings are for automatic document processing. If you select
2, 3, 4, or Auto Detect, you cannot zone text in the Document Preview
window.

Do not use multiple columns if your document contains tables or is of
an irregular format (see Figure 3-14) because the document format may
be changed in the output document.

You can also use preview tools to zone multiple-column pages instead
of choosing columns here.

Refer to Chapter 7 for complete information about using preview tools.

Next Page

The Next Page option keeps track of the current page number being
processed. Generally, you do not have to change it. When you first
start ScanWorX, the Next Page option is set to 1.

However, you can enter a page number manually for the next page you
intend to scan, for whatever reason. This is useful, for example, if
you are processing a job out of sequence. You can enter the next
number in sequence or any other number up to 999. Do not attempt to
use 0 or any number past 999 or you will receive an error message
during processing.

Pages

The Pages option lets you select either single-sided or double-sided
scanning. The default is Single-Sided.

Blank Pages Separate Documents

The Blank Pages Separate Documents option lets you inform ScanWorX
that blank pages are to be interpreted as document separators.

During scanning, each time ScanWorX encounters a blank page, it ends
the current output document and begins another one.

For example, if you wanted to scan 10 documents in a batch process,
you could insert a blank page in between each document, then load the
entire stack in the automatic document feeder.

Then, you could click the Start command, enter a file name and
directory, and proceed. The file name that you enter becomes the base
name of the multiple output files. For example, if you entered
`report' as the name, the 10 output files would be named as follows:

report-001.ext report-002.ext ... report-010.ext

Where the .ext is the extension of the output files that indicates the
text format you selected.

This option only works if you are processing single-sided documents.

Text Type

ScanWorX performs extremely accurate character recognition on a wide
variety of documents. However, it occasionally misreads characters,
particularly characters that are similar (Figure 3-15).

Figure 3-15. Characters that look similar during recognition

The Text Type option lets you define the types of text to be scanned.
Use this option to enhance character recognition on some types of
documents. For example, if you are scanning financial data you might
use the Numbers Only option.

By setting the correct Text Type, you can help the system do an even
better job of character recognition.

Three Text Type options are available - Alphanumeric, Letters Only,
and Numbers Only. Alphanumeric is the default setting.

Select Alphanumeric if your document contains both alphabetic
characters and numbers.

Select Letters Only for documents that contain only alphabet
characters and no (or only a few) numbers.

Select Numbers Only for documents, such as spreadsheets, that contain
all (or mostly) numbers.

Note

The system will still correctly recognize most characters, regardless
of the Text Type setting. Text Type simply provides one more level of
help for the ICR software.

Lexical Context

The Lexical Context setting provides another way to help the system in
the character recognition process. It provides three options, Enabled,
Disabled, and No Rules. Enabled is the default setting.

Select Enabled to specify that the system's language dictionary and
context rules are to be used during character recognition. If you load
a user dictionary, it will be used, as well.

Select Disabled if you want the system not to refer to the system (or
user) dictionary, but otherwise apply normal context rules.

Select No Rules to tell the system not to use either the dictionaries
or the context rules.

When you select Enabled, the system compares the words on scanned
pages to those in the lexicon(s) to verify their identity.

It also informs the system to use word definition (context) rules,
among them:

Words are composed of alphabetic characters only.

Uppercase characters appear only at the beginning of a word, unless
the entire word is capitalized.

Punctuation appears only in certain positions in a word.

If most of the text in the document consists of words that can be
found in a standard dictionary, you should select Enabled.

Enabled is the proper setting for most documents.

Select Disabled only to instruct the system not to look at any
dictionary. Select this if your document does not have many words - a
spreadsheet, for example, or uses terms and acronyms not found in a
dictionary.

Select No Rules if numbers and upper and lower case letters are
frequently mixed in the text (as in parts lists, for example).

Filtering

The Filtering option provides settings that also are helpful during
the character recognition process. None, the default, leaves filtering
off.

The Remove Halftones filter helps improve recognition accuracy and
speed on documents that contain halftone pictures. (Half-tones are
reproductions of continuous tone images that are made by a screening
process for printing purposes.)

By turning the Remove Halftones filter on, you assure that ScanWorX
does not waste time trying to interpret the halftone dots as text.

Another filtering capability - Enhance Dot Matrix - helps ScanWorX
recognize documents printed on draft-quality dot matrix printers,
which use dots to build characters (Figure 3-16).

Figure 3-16. Draft-quality dot matrix print

Ordinarily, on draft-quality dot matrix output, ScanWorX would notice
the white space between the dots, and thus would have difficulty
recognizing character shapes.

With Enhance Dot Matrix filtering on, ScanWorX compensates for the
white space and recognizes characters with greater accuracy.

Important

For most documents, including those with letter-quality, or
near-letter-quality, dot-matrix print, you should leave filtering set
to None. Otherwise, recognition accuracy and speed may suffer
considerably.

Confidence Level

The Confidence Level setting provides a slider bar that allows you to
set an assurance value for character recognition in the form of a
number between 0 and 10, inclusive.

During recognition, the system assigns a confidence level to each
character. If a system's confidence level for a character rises above
the confidence level that you set, the system regards that character
as being correctly identified.

If the system's confidence level falls below the number that you
specify, the system regards the character as being questionable
(possibly mis-recognized) and marks the word so you can check it when
you later edit the file.

Under Text Options in the Start window, you can specify a questionable
character marker that the system outputs in the text file in front of
each questionable character.

The higher the number you enter, the more likely that characters will
be marked as questionable. For most documents, a number in the middle
of the range is appropriate. The default is 5.

User Dictionary

The User Dictionary field displays the pathname of a currently loaded
dictionary, if there is one. If there is not one, the field (which is
always dimmed) displays the word `None'.

A user dictionary is an ASCII file that you create, containing up to
10,000 special words for technical, legal, scientific, or other
documents that may hold a great deal of special terminology.

Note

For information about creating a user dictionary, see Chapter 8, "Tips
and Techniques."

If you do not have a dictionary currently loaded, the default is None.
If you load a user dictionary, the system uses both the system
dictionary for the current language and your user dictionary. You use
the Choose User Dictionary command to load and unload a user
dictionary.

Choose User Dictionary

If you have created a user dictionary to aid in the recognition of a
particular document (or set of documents), you can use the Choose User
Dictionary command to load it. When you select Choose User Dictionary,
a window is displayed, which lets you locate and select the user
dictionary (Figure 3-17).

Figure 3-17. Load User Dictionary window

The Filename field shows the selected or currently loaded dictionary
file. The Directory field lists the current directory and may be
changed. The Show Files command lists files after you have changed the
current directory. The files in the directory are listed in the bottom
portion of the window. Click on a file to load it in the Filename
field. The Load command loads the selected dictionary file. The None
command unloads a dictionary, if one is currently loaded.

Language

The Language setting lets you select the language of the document you
intend to recognized. You have a choice of Danish, Dutch, English,
Finnish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish.
English is the default.

Scanner

When you are preparing to process text and/or images from a document,
the Scanner command lets you fine-tune controls that are built into
your scanner. Scanner settings are often critical to achieving a good
quality page image that the recognition system can process
successfully.

When you select the Scanner command in the Settings category, the
Scanner Settings window appears (Figure 3-18). Scanner settings are
discussed in the following subsections.

Figure 3-18. Scanner Settings window

Scanner Resolution

The Scanner Resolution setting allows you to choose 400, 300, or 200
dots per inch (dpi) resolution. In general, use 400 dpi for all text
scanning, and for the best resolution and best document quality. Use
300 dpi for image scanning, when your output device (for example,
laser printer) is 300 dpi.

Use 200 dpi only to scan line art images that do not require detail,
and also to save disk space.

Use Automatic Document Feeder

The Use Automatic Document Feeder setting lets you turn your automatic
document feeder (ADF) on and off.

Turn the ADF off when you want to place a document directly on the
platen of the scanner.

For most jobs, leave the Automatic Document Feeder on.

Because document feeders sometime introduce page skew, you may want to
disable the feeder and use the flatbed when you are scanning graphic
images.

 Output Brightness

The Output Brightness setting allows you to determine how dark or
light the scanned image will appear to ScanWorX. You can select one
of:

Normal

Light

Lighter

Dark

Darker

Custom

Normal is the default and is fine for most good-quality office
documents. However, if your documents are faintly or too darkly
printed, you can adjust output brightness accordingly to optimize
character recognition.

Select Custom to manually change the Brightness control on your
scanner. When you select Custom, the brightness slider bar becomes
available (is no longer dimmed). This way you can adjust the
Brightness level in finer increments.

Having the correct brightness setting is important for both text and
image scanning.

For text, when a page is scanned too lightly, the character images
become thinner and may break up. This results not only in poorer
recognition accuracy, but may also slow down processing.

If your original page was lightly printed to begin with, or the
typeface of the characters was very light with thin strokes, you can
adjust the Output Brightness setting to darken the scanned image.
Select the Dark setting or select Custom and move the slider toward
the left side of the bar (toward the 1). This should result in more
accurate character recognition.

Of course, it is possible to go too far in this direction. By making
the scanned image so dark that characters begin to touch and noise on
the page becomes visible, recognition accuracy suffers. Figure 3-19
shows a comparison of the same character images scanned with different
Output Brightness settings.

Figure 3-19. Different brightness settings

The current Brightness amount is shown in the bracketed text box to
the left of the slider bar. The default setting is typically in the
middle of the dial.

In general, for scanning graphic images, if your original image is
clean and crisp, use the Normal setting.

On the other hand, if your original image is overly dark or light,
adjust brightness to lighten or darken the output.

For example, if you are scanning a photograph, and the background is
very dark, select Light, or select Custom and specify a value on the
lighter side of the slider bar.

To determine the best brightness setting, you can preview the image in
the preview window. By using the magnifying glass tool, you can zoom
in on the scanned image at full resolution to determine if it is of
acceptable quality. See both `Preview' earlier in this chapter and
Chapter 7 for information about document previewing.

Text/Line Art

Click the Text/Line Art button (the default) if you are scanning text,
or if you are scanning line art (black-and-white) images.

Halftone

Select Halftone if you are scanning photographs or color images and
you want to output image files with the scanner's dithering patterns
to simulate gray tones. Halftone is dimmed unless you have selected
Image as the Process mode in the main window.

Halftone Pattern

The Halftone Pattern setting becomes available when you choose the
Halftone button. It lets you select from a list of halftone dithering
patterns to simulate continuous-tone images.

Continuous tone images, such as photographs, contain a gradient of
colors, or gray tones, ranging from white to black.

The printing press (as well as typesetters and most laser printers)
print only one color at a time - black, for example.

Consequently, the printing press has to simulate the gray tones of a
photograph by printing halftones, black dots of varying sizes that
give the appearance of gray tones.

In traditional page make-up, halftones are made by a screening process
that photographs the original image through a very fine glass or
contact screen. The resulting image is a series of different-sized
black dots.

Similarly, your scanner can only scan one color - black; so it uses
another method of continuous-tone simulation, called dithering.

Dithering is the arrangement of black dots in particular patterns to
represent gradient tones. Figure 3-20 shows some examples of halftone
patterns available from your ScanWorX scanner.

Figure 3-20. Dithering patterns (300 dpi)

Dithering is similar to traditional halftoning. The difference,
however, is that your scanner has only one dot (pixel) size.

Your scanner's highest resolution determines the pixel size. The
ScanWorX scanner's highest resolution is 400 dots per inch, the pixel
size is 1/400 of a inch.

The ScanWorX scanner has 10 built-in halftone patterns from which you
can choose:

Diagonal

Random

Spiral

Horizontal

Vertical

Small Spiral

Forty-five Degrees

High Gradation

High Contrast

Fine Dot

Select a pattern that would apply an appropriate treatment to a
particular halftone image that is being scanned.

Look in the Document Preview window to determine which is the best
treatment for your halftone image.

The previewed image is only meaningful if you zoom in as far as
possible.

Save

In the Settings category, the Save command allows you to save the
current settings to a named settings file. Creating and using settings
files is a quick way to set up your system for a particular type of
job.

When you click the Save command, ScanWorX displays the Save Settings
window, which allows you to define the directory and name in which to
store the settings (Figure 3-21).

Figure 3-21. Save Settings window

Load

The Load command lets you load an existing settings file for fast job
set up. When you select Load, the system displays the Load Settings
window (Figure 3-22).

Figure 3-22. Load Settings window

The Load Settings window lets you specify the name of the file, and
the directory location. The Show Files button lists the settings
(.@in) files in the current directory.

You can click a file in the list to install the name in the Filename
field above. When you are ready, click Load to put the settings in
place for the job at hand.

These settings remain intact until you either load another settings
file or select Restore Defaults to return to the ScanWorX default
settings.

Save as Defaults

The Save As Defaults command allows you to save the current settings
and window configurations as the defaults ScanWorX uses when you start
the application. A default settings file is saved in your home
directory. It is named:

ksun.@in

Thus, when you quit ScanWorX and start it back up, all settings and
windows (for example, the Preview window) will be as you left them
when you executed the Save As Defaults command.

Restore Defaults

The Restore Defaults command restores the ScanWorX defaults that are
shipped with the system.

If you have changed and saved settings with the Save as Defaults
command, you can restore the system defaults with the Restore Defaults
command.

ScanWorx User's Guide

Scanning Documents

ScanWorX User's Guide

To import paper documents and graphics into files on your Sun
workstation, ScanWorX provides versatile scanning capabilities.

Supporting a number of industry-standard file formats, the ScanWorX
system can scan text, graphics, or both from practically any document.

For text processing, you can convert documents into formats compatible
with Interleaf, FrameMaker, several text-only (ASCII) formats, KDOC
and Format Analyzed Text, two ScanWorX proprietary formats.

For image processing, you can scan drawings and photographs, and
output them as line art or halftone files. For halftones, you can
select one of 10 dithering patterns to be applied to the scanned
image.

At your instruction, images can be output to a variety of popular
image file formats - Sun Rasterfile (Standard and Encoded), Interleaf
(IGF), and several TIFF variations (uncompressed, CCITT-3, and
CCITT-4).

This chapter provides step-by-step instructions for using the ScanWorX
system for document scanning, specifically covering these topics:

Scanning text

Scanning images

Scanning text and images together

Note

This chapter describes document scanning without the use of the
system's text verification or previewing capabilities. For information
about text verification, see Chapter 6. For information about
previewing, see Chapter 7.

Getting Started

The procedures in the following sections assume that your hardware and
software has been completely installed.

Scanning Documents

With those tasks accomplished, you can start up the ScanWorX
Intelligent Scanning System. In OPEN LOOK, to start the ScanWorX
system from a UNIX shell tool window, type:

icr

In a few moments, the ScanWorX splash window appears on your desktop.
Click on the splash screen and the main window appears (Figure 4-1).

Figure 4-1. Main window

You can now go on to scan and recognize text, graphic images, or both.
Procedures for these tasks are provided in the next three major
sections of this chapter.

Scanning Text

One of the ScanWorX system's most important capabilities is text
processing - scanning one or more pages and converting the text on
those pages to a file in any one of the supported formats.

After the file is created, you can use a desktop publishing or text
application to edit, format, or otherwise process the text.

This section describes how to prepare for, and perform, text scanning
and recognition with your ScanWorX system. Specifically it describes
how to:

Specify document settings

Specify scanner settings

Start the job and specify text options

Process the document

Note

One way to streamline the setup process for a job is to load a
settings file. Use the Load command from the main window. For more
information, refer to Chapter 3.

Specify document settings

Document settings inform the system about the document you intend to
process. These settings include page settings and recognition
settings.

Page settings include page orientation, page size, and column layout
of the document to be processed. Recognition settings describe the
text about to be processed.

Refer to the "Settings" section in Chapter 3 for more information
about document settings.

To specify document settings, use the following procedure:

1.

Select the Document Settings command from the main window.

The Document Settings window appears (Figure 4-2, next page). The Page
Settings are on the left side of the window; the Recognition Settings
are on the right.

Figure 4-2. Documentation Settings window

2.

Specify document settings, as appropriate for the document about to be
processed.

Use Table 4-1 as a guide.

3.

Click Done to close the Document Settings window.

Table 4-1. Document Settings for Text Scanning

Setting, Tips

Orientation, Specify Portrait for most documents,, and feed them into
the scanner accordingly. Specify Landscape if print runs horizontally
across the length of the page,, and page length exceeds 11.6 inches.
Such pages (for example,, legal-sized landscape pages) are too large
to feed as "portrait" pages.

Page Size, Click on the list and select one of the page sizes.

Columns, In general,, specify an explicit number of columns (1,, 2,,
3,, or 4) for pages that have evenly-spaced columns of equal width.
Specify Auto Detect when you are scanning pages with an irregular
layout,, or one that has more than four columns.

Next Page, Specify the number of the next page you want scanned. In
general,, if the next page is a new document,, use the default
setting,, 1.

Pages, Specify single-sided if your input document is single-sided.
Specify double-sided if your input document is double-sided.

Blank Pages Separate Documents, Turn on if you plan to scan multiple
documents as part of the same job. ScanWorX will then interpret a
blank page as the start of a new document and open a new output file
automatically.

Text Type, Use Alphanumeric if your input document has both numbers
and letters. Select Numbers Only if you are scanning financial data,,
and Letters Only if your input has few or no numbers.

Lexical Context, Select Enabled to specify that the system's language
dictionary and context rules are to be used during character
recognition. If you load a user dictionary,, it will be used,, as
well.

, Select Disabled to prevent the system from use the system (or user)
lexicon.

, Select No Rules to tell the system not to use either the lexicon(s)
or the context rules.

Filtering, Specify None to keep all filters off when you are scanning.
Specify Remove Halftones to have the system filter out embedded
halftone pictures and speed up recognition. Specify Enhance Dot Matrix
when you are scanning draft-quality dot matrix documents.

Confidence Level, The Confidence Level is an assurance value that the
recognition software tries to attain for each character before it
releases it as "recognized correctly." The higher the confidence
level,, the greater the number of characters that the system will flag
as possibly incorrect.

User Dictionary, This is a non-editable text field containing the name
of the currently loaded user dictionary,, if there is one. To load or
unload a user dictionary,, use the Choose User Dictionary option.

Choose User Dictionary, Provide the full pathname in the provided
window of a user dictionary you want to use.

Load Language, Specify the primary language of the document being
recognized. English is the default.

Specify scanner settings

Generally, default scanner settings should be adequate for
good-quality documents.

For other documents, use scanner settings to adjust scanner controls -
for example, Output Brightness.

To adjust scanner settings:

1.

From the Settings category in the main window, select the Scanner
command.

The Scanner window appears (Figure 4-3).

Figure 4-3. Scanner settings window

2.

Adjust settings, as appropriate, for the document about to be
processed.

Use Table 4-2 as a guide.

3.

Click Done to accept the new scanner settings.

Table 4-2. Scanner Settings for Text Scanning

Setting, Tips

Scanner Resolution, Use the default (400 dpi) for all text documents.
400 dpi offers the best resolution and document quality.

Use Automatic Document Feeder, Leave on unless you are placing pages
(either loose or bound) manually on the flatbed.

Output Brightness, Original documents may vary considerably in terms
of the darkness of the text,, the lightness of the background,, and
the amount of noise (dirt,, smeared ink,, finger-prints,,
handwriting,, and other marks) on the page.

, Leave on Normal unless the input document is very dark or very
light.

, Try using one of the lighter settings (Light,, Lighter) if
characters on your page appear too bold,, are starting to fill in or
are touching,, or words are separated by very small spaces (as in some
magazines). Also,, recognition of documents with a lot of background
noise,, or with colored backgrounds,, may improve considerably by
using a lighter setting.


, Try using a darker setting (Dark,, Darker) if characters on the page
appear faint,, broken,, or very thin.

, Select Custom to access the slider bar so that you can adjust
brightness at finer increments.

Text/Line Art, This setting must be left on for processing text
documents.

Halftone, Leave off for text scanning. (Trying to select this when
your Process mode is Text or Both generates an Alert message.)

Start a new job

From the main window, to start a new document, use the following
procedure:

1.

Specify Scanner as the Input Source.

The Scanner button is highlighted.

2.

Select Text as the Process type.

The Text button is highlighted.

Go on to process the document.

Refer to the next section. Do not click Done in the Start Processing
window, yet.

Process the document

After you complete all steps in "Start a new job," you can process
your single-sided or double-sided document. For instructions, refer to
one of the following subsections, as appropriate.

Process a single-sided document

To process a single-sided document, use the following procedure:

1.

Load the document in the scanner.

The scanner's ADF capacity is 50 pages, the recommended maximum of
pages to process during a single job. If your document is larger, scan
it as more than one job.

Figure 4-6 shows you how to load pages in the scanner's ADF.

Figure 4-6. Loading the ADF

2.

Start scanning.

Follow the steps in the previous section, "Start a new job.

In the Start Processing window, click Done.

The scanner scans all the pages in the ADF. When all pages have been
scanned, the system displays the Out of Input window (Figure 4-7).

Figure 4-7. Out of Input window

3.

Continue, cancel, or end the document.

To process more pages of the document, go to Step 4. To suspend
processing temporarily (to change settings, for example), or to abort
the document, go to Step 5. To end the document and convert the
recognized text to a file formatted for your text application, go to
Step 6.

4.

Load more pages in the scanner, then click Continue.

The system scans and recognizes the pages, then again displays the
window shown in Figure 4-7. Proceed from Step 3 to continue, cancel,
or end the document.

5.

To temporarily suspend processing, click Interrupt.

This lets you interrupt processing. You can later click Resume on the
main window and provide the filename when you want to resume
processing.

6.

When you are done, click the End Document button.

The system outputs the recognized text to the selected formatted file
type that you can use with your word processing, desktop publishing,
or other text application.

Process a double-sided document

ScanWorX features automatic collation of double-sided documents. Thus,
you can scan all the odd pages first, then flip the stack and scan the
reverse sides (Figure 4-8).

Figure 4-8. Double-sided document scanning

ScanWorX automatically collates the scanned data in the correct order
in the output file. If you set up the job for processing a
double-sided document, you are ready to begin processing.

1.

Load the document in the scanner.

Refer to Figure 4-6 for page placement directions. Place the
double-sided stack in the ADF so that the first righthand page will be
scanned first.

The scanner's ADF capacity is 50 pages. However, it is recommended
that you process no more than 50 page sides during a single job. If
your document is larger, process it as more than one job.

2.

Start scanning.

Follow the steps in an earlier section, "Start a new job," then click
Done in the Start Processing window.

The scanner scans the odd sides of all the pages in the ADF. When all
pages have been scanned, the system displays the Out of Input window
(Figure 4-9).

Figure 4-9. Out of Input window

3.

Continue, cancel, or end the document.

If you want to process more righthand (front sides of) pages, go to
Step 4.

If you want to process the reverse sides of the double-sided pages, go
to Step 5.

If you want to end the document before ScanWorX scanned the even
pages, recognized text, converted, automatically collated, and output
the document to a file formatted for your text application, go to Step
6.

4.

Load more pages in the scanner, then click Continue.

The system scans and recognizes the pages, then again displays the
window shown in Figure 4-9. Proceed from Step 3 to continue, cancel,
or end the document.

5.

Process the reverse (even-numbered) sides of pages.

Turn the stack over and place it in the ADF so that the last
even-numbered page is in position to be scanned next.

Click the Flip and Continue button. The Next Page number in the
Document Settings window is updated appropriately and scanning
resumes. Eventually, the Out of Input window is redisplayed.

If you have scanned multiple stacks of pages, be sure to process the
reverse sides in descending order.

If you have very large double-sided documents (over 100 pages) to
process, it is recommended that you scan the document as a series of
separate jobs, then combine the multiple output files with your text
processing application. Otherwise, you may generate a system error
because of memory overflow.

Proceed from Step 3 to continue, cancel, or end the document.

6.

End the job.

When you are done processing all pages of the document, click the End
Document button.

The system outputs the recognized text in the selected format.

During the conversion process, the system performs automatic
collation, during which it sequences the scanned text in the same
order it appeared in the original double-sided document.

Scanning Graphic Images

The ScanWorX system enables you to easily scan graphics to useable
image files on your workstation.

You can scan line art, a photograph, or color illustration, and
process the image in two ways: as binary (black-and-white) data; or as
data in one of 10 dithered halftone patterns. Figure 4-10 shows
examples of both types of images.

Figure 4-10. Two types of image data

At your direction, the image data is output to any one of a variety of
industry-standard image file formats: Sun Rasterfile (Standard and
Encoded); Interleaf (IGF); or TIFF (Uncompressed, CCITT-3, or
CCITT-4).

The following subsections provide procedures to scan an image,
specifically describing how to:

Specify document settings

Specify scanner settings

Process the image

Note

Because image files can take up a great deal of disk space, you may
want to use preview tools to create image zones to more precisely
control the image area that is processed. See Chapter 7 for
information.

Specify document settings

For image scanning, only some of the settings in the Document Settings
window are appropriate.

These are Orientation and Page Size.

To specify document settings for image scanning:

1.

In the main window, click the Document command.

The Document Settings window appears (refer to Figure 4-2).

2.

Specify document settings, as appropriate for the graphic image about
to be processed.

Use Table 4-4 as a guide.

3.

Click Done.

The Document Settings window closes.

Table 4-4. Document Settings for Image Scanning

Setting, Tips

Orientation, For all but the largest images,, you can specify Portrait
orientation.

, Specify Landscape only if the image is larger than can be
accommodated in portrait mode on the ScanWorX scanner flatbed.

, Place the image directly on the flatbed to avoid skew that can be
introduced by the ADF.

Size, Click on the list and select the standard page size that most
closely approximates the size of your image.

Other settings, For image scanning,, ignore all other settings in the
Document Settings window.

Specify scanner settings

To specify image scanning and define scanner settings:

1.

From the Process category in the main window, click Image.

The Image button is turned on.

2.

Select Scanner Settings from the main window.

The Scanner Settings window appears (refer to Figure 4-3).

3.

Specify scanner settings.

Use Table 4-5 as a guide.

4.

Click Done.

The Scanner Settings window closes.

Table 4-5. Scanner Settings for Image Scanning

Setting, Tips

Scanner Resolution, You can select one of three resolutions (dots per
inch,, or dpi): 400 (the default); 300; or 200.

^, In general,, the highest available resolution achieves the most
detailed image. To obtain the most accurate image file,, you should
try to match the resolution of the scanned image with the device you
will eventually use to print it. For example,, if you have a 300 dpi
laser printer,, you should scan the image at 300 dpi.

^, If the image to be scanned is relatively simple,, for example,, a
flowchart or a floor plan,, you can choose a lower resolution. This
reduces the amount of time it takes to scan and recognize the image,,
and the amount of disk space the resulting image file requires.

^, If you are scanning a continuous tone (contone) image,, the higher
the resolution,, the greater the number of gray levels that can be
represented by the halftone pattern,, thus the more accurate the
resulting image file.

Use Automatic Document Feeder, It is recommended that you click this
setting off. Scan images on the flatbed to get the straightest
possible image. The ADF can introduce page skew that can cause the
image to be scanned at an angle.

Output Brightness, Brightness determines how light or dark the scanned
image is when output to a file. The default setting is Normal and is
adequate for most good-quality images.

^, Select one of the other general settings to achieve a lighter or
darker image. Select Custom if you want to adjust the brightness bar
at finer increments.

^, For example,, if you are scanning a photograph of a person,, and
the background is very dark,, select Light or Lighter (or a lighter
Custom setting) to lighten the image.

^, If you are scanning a line drawing with very light lines,, specify
Darker or Dark (or a darker Custom setting).

^, Of course,, you can use preview tools (Chapter 7) to scan and
evaluate the brightness of an image before processing it to a file.

^, Experiment with different settings on sample scanning runs. With
experience,, you should develop a good instinct for setting
brightness.

Text/ Line Art Halftone, Determines the type of image data that is
written to the output file.

^, Select Text/Line Art if you are scanning a black and white line
drawing,, or want to achieve a posterized look from a continuous-tone
image.

^, Select Halftone to simulate the continuous tones of a photograph or
color illustration with different bit-mapped patterns and densities of
black dots.

Halftone Pattern, If image type is Halftone,, you can specify one of
10 halftone patterns. These settings are dimmed (not available) if you
specify Text/Line Art.

Process the image

After you specify document and scanner settings, you can process the
image, as follows:

1.

Select the Start command from the main window.

The Start Processing window is displayed (Figure 4-11).

Figure 4-11. Start Processing window

2.

Specify the output directory

3.

Specify the image file name.

Point to the Filename field, and type a file name. UNIX file naming
conventions apply (no spaces, use underscores to delineate words, and
so on). Do not include a file extension.

This is the base name that is used for the image file(s) created
during a session. Because multiple images may use the same image name,
the system appends a three-digit page number to the file name. For
example, if you typed "monitor" as the base name, the first file name
would be:

	monitor_pg001.ext

4.

Select the Image Format.

Cycle through available formats, or use the right mouse button to
display a pop-up menu.

These image formats are supported:

	Interleaf (IGF)
	TIFF Uncompressed
	TIFF CCITT3 TIFF CCITT4 Sun Rasterfile Standard Sun Rasterfile
Encoded

5.

Click Done.

ScanWorX displays the Start Processing window and scans the image on
the flatbed. Then, the system displays the Out of Input window (refer
to Figure 4-7).

6.

Continue or end the job.

To continue go to Step 7. To end the job, go to Step 8.

7.

Place another image on the scanner flatbed, then click Continue.

The image is processed to the same base name.

Proceed from Step 6 to scan more images. Otherwise, go to Step 8.

8.

To end the image scanning document, from the Out of Input window
select End Document.

The image(s) that you scanned are written to image files on your Sun
system.

Scanning Text and Images Together

During text scanning, ScanWorX creates a binary image of the page and
then performs character recognition on the image. Any graphics on the
page are ignored.

During image scanning, ScanWorX reads all print on the page as black
and white pixels (picture elements), storing the data in the specified
image file format (for example, TIFF).

ScanWorX also provides a method for processing a document as both text
and images at the same time. This is sometimes referred to as compound
scanning (Figure 4-12).

Figure 4-12. Compound scanning process

To specify compound scanning, you select Both from the Process
category of the main window.

When you process a document in this way, the system produces a text
file containing the recognized text of the document, and an individual
image file for each page of the document.

With compound scanning, you can specify that the page images be saved
only as binary (Text/Line Art) data.

When to scan text and images together

With compound scanning, you can process pages for a variety of
reasons. For example, you might want to use compound scanning in these
situations:

You want to recognize the text of a document for editing or data
retrieval purposes, while storing archival "snapshots" of the pages on
disk.

You want to quickly scan all the text and graphics in a document.
Later, you intend to use an image editing application to "grab" the
graphic images.

Alternatively, you can use the ScanWorX preview features to accomplish
the same goals. Refer to Chapter 7 for complete information.

You are scanning a multiple-page document which you eventually want to
output to a number of different formats. You can process the text to
the first text format you want to output and the page images to TIFF
files. Then, later at your convenience, you can process the text
and/or images from the TIFF files to other output formats (see Chapter
5).

Prepare the job

Similar to preparation for text or image scanning, to prepare for
compound scanning, you may need to specify document settings and
scanner settings.

Procedures for completing these tasks are presented in the "Scanning
Text" section earlier in this chapter. Refer to that section for
details.

Process the document

From the main window, to process a compound document, use the
following procedure:

1.

Load the document in the scanner, and in the main window, specify
Scanner as the Input Source.

Refer to Figure 4-6, which shows how to load the scanner.

The scanner's ADF capacity is 50 pages, the recommended maximum of
pages to process during a single job. If your document is larger, scan
it as more than one job.

2.

Select Both as the Process type.

The Both button is highlighted.

3.

Select the Start command from the main window.

The Start Processing window appears (Figure 4-13).

Figure 4-13. Start Processing window

4.

Optionally, specify a different output directory.

The current directory is shown in the Directory field. Highlight the
directory path and type the new directory name.

5.

Specify the document name.

Point to the Filename field, and type a file name. UNIX file naming
conventions apply (no spaces, use underscores to delineate words, and
so on). Do not include a file extension.

6.

Specify the Text Format and the Image Format.

For both format settings, cycle through the choices or choose from a
pop-up menu by clicking on the option with the right mouse button.

7.

Define the Text Options.

Click the Text Options button to display another window. Click Done
when you are done. Refer to Table 4-3 earlier in this chapter as a
guide.

8.

In the Start Processing window, click Done.

The scanner scans all the pages in the ADF. When all pages have been
scanned, the system displays the Out of Input window (refer to Figure
4-7).

9.

Continue, cancel, or end the document.

To process more pages of the document, go to Step 10.

To suspend processing temporarily (to change settings, for example),
or to abort the document, go to Step 11. To end the document and
convert the recognized text to a file formatted for your text
application, go to Step 12.

10.

Load more pages in the scanner, then click Continue.

The system scans and recognizes the pages, then again displays the
window shown in Figure 4-7. Proceed from Step 3 to continue, cancel,
or end the document.

11.

To temporarily suspend processing, click Interrupt.

This lets you interrupt processing. You can later click Resume on the
main window and provide the filename when you want to resume
processing.

12.

When you are done, click the End Document button.

The system outputs recognized text to the specified format for use
with your text application.

In addition, page images are stored in image files on your hard disk
in the specified format.

ScanWorx User's Guide

Delayed Processing with TIFF Files

ScanWorX User's Guide

Suppose you have a large document that you want to scan and recognize.
You could load your scanner, select Scanner as the Input Source and
Text as the Process type.

Then, as described in Chapter 4, you could direct ScanWorX to process
the document. ScanWorX would scan the first page and recognize the
text from this page. Then it would scan and recognize the second page.
For each additional page, it would repeat the process.

You would have to remain close by to monitor the process, reload the
document feeder, correct any paper jams, and so on.

Alternatively, you could scan the pages as binary page images and
store them in individual TIFF files in considerably less time.

After all page images are stored as TIFF files on your hard disk, you
could direct ScanWorX to start processing the TIFF files. While
ScanWorX processed the files, you could perform other tasks, or go
home.

This ScanWorX capability is referred to as delayed processing,
designed to let you take full advantage of your equipmenteven during
off-peak hours when you are away from your office.

TIFF (for Tag Image File Format) was developed as an industry-standard
format in which scanned (and other) images could be stored and used in
supporting applications.

In the main window, the TIFF Queue command is central to the system's
delayed processing capabilities. It lets you select and define the
order in which multiple TIFF files are to be processed.

The clear advantage of delayed processing is that you do not have to
be present to monitor the recognition and conversion processthe most
computer-intensive (and time-consuming) part of capturing documents.

Delayed Processing with TIFF Files

You need only be present for the time it takes ScanWorX to produce the
TIFF files, which is considerably faster than actually performing text
recognition.

Then, you can direct ScanWorX to process the TIFF files just as if
they were page images coming in from the scanner.

ScanWorX automatically recognizes the text and converts and outputs it
to a file that you can use with your desktop publishing or text
application. When you return, you can immediately begin editing or
otherwise processing the file.

In addition, you can retain the page images in TIFF files for other
purposes, such as on-line imaging.

ScanWorX supports output and input of TIFF files in TIFF Uncompressed,
TIFF CCITT-3, and TIFF CCITT-4. (Thus, you can process TIFF files from
other systems, as well.)

Note

An 8.5-by-11-inch page image may take up to 1.5 million bytes when
stored as TIFF Uncompressed. To save disk space, use the compressed
forms of TIFF (CCITT-3 or CCITT-4) that ScanWorX supports.

This chapter describes how to create and process TIFF files via the
TIFF Queue.

Specifically, these topics are presented:

Getting started

3.

Click Done.

The Document Settings window closes.

Table 5-1. Document Settings for TIFF File Creation

Setting, Tips

Orientation, For all but very large pages,, you can specify Portrait
orientation. Specify Landscape only if pages are larger than can be
accommodated in portrait mode by the ScanWorX ADF.

Size, Select the standard page size that most closely approximates the
size of your pages.

Pages, If you are creating TIFF files from a single-sided document,,
select Single-sided. If you are creating TIFF files from a
double-sided document,, select Double-sided.

Other settings, For TIFF file creation,, ignore all other settings in
the Document Settings window.

Specify scanner settings

To specify image scanning and define scanner settings for TIFF file
creation:

1.

As the Process type in the main window, click Image.

The Image button is turned on (refer to Figure 5-1).

2.

Select Scanner Settings from the main window.

The Scanner Settings window appears (Figure 5-3).

Specify scanner settings.

Use Table 5-2 (next page) as a guide.

4.

Click Done.

The Scanner Settings window closes.

Table 5-2. Scanner Settings for TIFF File Creation

Setting, Tips

Scanner Resolution, In general,, the highest available resolution
(dots per inch,, or dpi) achieves the most detailed image.

^, You can select either 400 (the default) or 300. Do not select 200
dpi or character recognition can suffer measurably.

^, For best results in later text recognition,, leave at 400 dpi.

^, If you have limitations in disk space,, you can specify 300 dpi to
produce 25% smaller TIFF files. Character recognition should be
acceptable with 300 dpi resolution.

Use Automatic Document Feeder, Click this on if you intend to use the
ADF (the fastest method). Click it off if you prefer to place pages
directly on the flatbed.

^, ScanWorX can correct for skew (up to five degrees) in the page
image introduced by the ADF.

Output Brightness, Brightness determines how light or dark the scanned
page image is when output to a file. The default setting is Normal and
is adequate for most good-quality documents.

^, Select one of the other general settings to achieve a lighter or
darker page image. Select Custom if you want to adjust the brightness
bar at finer increments.

^, For example,, if you are scanning a document with dark print,, and
type looks heavy with touching characters,, select Light or Lighter
(or a lighter Custom setting) to lighten the scanned page images.

^, Also for documents printed on a screened background,, specify a
lighter brightness setting.

^, If you are scanning a document with faded or light print,, specify
Darker or Dark (or a darker Custom setting).

^, Of course,, you can use preview tools (Chapter 7) to scan and
evaluate the brightness of an image before processing it to a file.

^, Experiment with different settings on sample scanning runs. With
experience,, you should develop a good instinct for setting
brightness.

Text/ Line Art, For TIFF files from which you want to recognize text
at a later time,, you must specify Text/Line Art.

Halftone Halftone Pattern, Avoid these settings for TIFF files that
you are creating for delayed processing (text recognition).

Process the document

After you have specified settings for TIFF file creation, you are
ready to process the document. Use the following procedure to create
TIFF files from scanned pages:

1.

Load the document in the scanner.

Figure 5-4 illustrates how to load pages in the scanner's ADF.

The ADF capacity is 50 pages. For a more detailed discussion of
loading pages in the scanner, refer to Chapter 2.

Figure 5-4. Loading the ADF

2.

In the main window, Specify Scanner as the Input Source.

The Scanner button is highlighted.

3.

Select Image as the Process type.

The Image button is highlighted.

4.

Select the Start command from the main window.

The Start Processing window appears (Figure 5-5).

Figure 5-5. Start Processing window

5.

Specify the output directory in the Directory field.

The current directory is shown in the Directory field. Output file are
stored here. Type another directory path if you want your TIFF files
stored elsewhere.

It is a good idea to store all TIFF files for a particular document in
their own directory.

6.

Specify the file name for the TIFF files to be created.

Point to the Filename field, and type a file name. UNIX file naming
conventions apply (no spaces, use underscores to delineate words, and
so on). Do not include a file extension.

This is the base name that is used for the image file(s) created
during a session. Because multiple images may use the same image name,
the system appends a three-digit page number to the file name. For
example, if you typed "monitor" as the base name, the first file name
would be:

       monitor_pg001.ext

7.

Select the preferred Image Format.

Cycle through available formats, or use the right mouse button to
display a pop-up menu. Select one of:

       TIFF Uncompressed
       TIFF CCITT-3
       TIFF CCITT-4

TIFF CCITT-3, CCITT-4 are compressed forms of TIFF. Files stored in
these formats take up considerably less space than TIFF Uncompressed,
and actually take less time to process. Table 5-3 provides some
statistics that may help you decide which TIFF format to choose.

Table 5-3. Choosing a TIFF Format;

Format, File Size* (approximate), Time To Process (approximate)

TIFF Uncompressed, 1.8 million bytes, 40 seconds

TIFF CCITT-3, 84,000 bytes, 11 seconds

TIFF CCITT-4, 33,500 bytes, 13 seconds

* Based on one 8.5-by-11-inch,, single-column page scanned by ScanWorX
and written to disk on a networked Sun SLC workstation., +, +


8.


Click Done in the Start Processing window to begin scanning and
creation of the TIFF files.

ScanWorX displays the Processing Document window and begins scanning
the pages in the scanner.

After each page is scanned, it is immediately converted to TIFF and
written to disk.

The scanner scans all the pages in the ADF (or the first page on the
flatbed if you are not using the ADF).

When all pages have been scanned, the system displays the Out of Input
window (Figure 5-6).

Figure 5-6. Out of Input window

9.

Continue or end the document.

To process more pages of a single-sided document, go directly to Step
10. To process the reverse sides of a double-sided document, go to
Step 11. To end the document, go to Step 12.

10.

Load more pages in the scanner, then click Continue.

The system scans the pages and creates TIFF files, then again displays
the window shown in Figure 5-6. Proceed from Step 9 to continue or end
the document.

11.

Flip the stack of double-sided pages in the ADF, then click Flip and
Continue.

The system scans the reverse sides of pages, performs auto-collation,
and creates and names the TIFF files correctly. It then redisplays the
window shown in Figure 5-6. Proceed to Step 12 to end the document.

12.

To end the document, click End Document.

All scanned pages have now been successfully written to TIFF files.

Preparing the TIFF Queue

To define the TIFF files that the system is to process, and the order
in which they are processed, you use the TIFF Queue Manager.

First, from the main window, select TIFF as the Input Source, then
select the TIFF Queue command in the Main window. This displays the
TIFF Queue Manager (Figure 5-7).

Figure 5-7. TIFF Queue Manager

Specifically, the TIFF Queue Manager enables you to:

Show TIFF files in the current directory

Select TIFF files in the current directory

Add TIFF files to the queue

Remove a TIFF file from the queue

Clear the queue (remove all files )

Accept or cancel changes and close the queue

Note

You cannot remove TIFF files from your hard disk using the TIFF Queue
Manager. For this, use the UNIX rm (remove) command in a OPEN LOOK
shell tool.

Show TIFF files in the current directory

With the TIFF Queue Manager open on your desktop, you can specify a
directory, and list the files in this directory, as follows:

1.

Point to the Directory field.

The diamond cursor becomes the flashing inverted triangle, indicating
you can edit the Directory field.

2.

Specify a new directory.

Type Control-U to clear the Directory field.

Type a new directory in the Directory field.

3.

Click the Show Files command:

The TIFF files in the directory appear in the middle window of the
TIFF Queue Manager (refer to Figure 5-7).

Select TIFF files to add to the queue

After you show TIFF files in the current directory, you can select
files to add to the TIFF Queue. The TIFF Queue manager provides
several ways to select files:

one at a time

multiple files in sequence

with the Select All command

Select TIFF files one at a time

In the middle window, point to a file and, using the left mouse
button, click on it. The file is highlighted. You can do this as many
times as necessary to highlight multiple files in random order.

To deselect a highlighted file, click on it with the right mouse
button.

Select multiple files in sequence

To select multiple files in sequence, point to the first file, click
and hold the left mouse button, and drag the mouse downward across the
files to be selected. The files in the sequence are highlighted.

You can also point to a file, click and hold the left mouse button,
and drag the mouse upward.

Select all TIFF files in the current directory

To quickly select all files in the current directory, click the Select
All command:

It is recommended that you store all TIFF files relating to a single
document in their own directory. This way, you can simply click Select
All to add them to the queue in the correct processing order.

You can also quickly deselect all selected files by clicking:

Add files on the queue

After you highlight files, the TIFF Queue Manager enables you to add
them to the queue. These can be TIFF files that you create using
ScanWorX, or TIFF files from other sources.

To load TIFF files into the TIFF Queue, click the Add command:

Be careful not to add halftone or grayscale TIFF files to the queue.
Only binary TIFF files should be used for delayed processing.
Otherwise, ScanWorX will have difficulty recognizing them, and may
generate an error.

After you add selected files in the current directory to the TIFF
Queue, you can change to another directory, list and select more TIFF
files, and add these to the queue, as well.

The horizontal line in the TIFF Queue indicates the insertion point
where files will be added (Figure 5-8). It also indicates the current
file. By clicking on a file in the TIFF queue, you move the horizontal
line directly beneath it.

Figure 5-8. Horizontal line in the TIFF Queue

Remove a file from the queue

The TIFF Queue Manager lets you remove files, one at a time, from the
TIFF Queue. To do so, use the following procedure:

1.

Click on the file with the mouse.

The horizontal line moves to directly beneath the file you selected.
This indicates the current file (refer to Figure 5-8).

2.

Click the Remove button:

The file is removed from the TIFF Queue, and the numbers indicating
processing order are updated.

Observe that the horizontal line is now beneath the previous file in
the queue list, making it the current file. You can insert a new file
at this stage, or click Remove again to remove this file.

Clear the queue

To remove all files from the TIFF queue, click the Remove All command:

Close the queue

When the TIFF Queue is set up the way you want it, click Done to
accept the changes and close the window:

You are now ready to process the TIFF Queue.

To close the window without accepting the changes you have made to the
queue, click the Cancel command:

Processing the TIFF Queue

After you use the TIFF Queue Manager to load TIFF files into the TIFF
Queue and click Done, you can direct ScanWorX to recognize the files.

For recognition purposes, ScanWorX treats each file in the queue the
same as a page image coming in from the scanner. Therefore, processing
the TIFF queue requires many of the same steps as scanning a document.
Specifically, you will need to:

Specify document settings

Process the TIFF Queue

Note

One way to streamline the setup process for a job is to load a
settings file. Use the Load command from the main window. For more
information, refer to Chapter 3.

Specify document settings

Document settings inform the system about the document you intend to
process from the TIFF files.

Document settings include page settings (such as orientation, page
size, and column layout) and recognition settings, which describe the
text about to be processed.

Refer to the "Settings" section in Chapter 3 for more information
about document settings.

 To specify document settings, use the following procedure:

1.

Select the Document Settings command from the main window.

The Document Settings window appears (refer to Figure 5-2).

2.

Specify document settings, as appropriate for the document about to be
processed.

Use Table 5-4 (next page) as a guide.

3.

Click Done.

The Document Settings window closes.

Table 5-4. Document Settings for TIFF Recognition

Setting, Tips

Orientation, Specify Portrait unless you know that the TIFF file was
scanned in a landscape orientation. In this case,, specify Landscape.

Page Size, Click on the list and select the same page size you
specified when you created the TIFF files.

If the TIFF file is from another application,, specify a page size
that will accommodate the TIFF file.

Columns, Specify an explicit number of columns (1,, 2,, 3, or 4) for
pages that have evenly-spaced columns of equal width.

^, Specify Auto Detect when processing page images with an irregular
layout or more than four columns.

Next Page, Specify the number of the next page you want scanned. In
general,, if the next page is a new document,, use the default
setting,, 1.

Pages, Specify single-sided.

Blank Pages Separate Documents, Turn on if you plan to process
multiple documents and you have inserted blank TIFF files in the queue
to separate documents. ScanWorX will interpret blank TIFF files as the
start of a new document and open a new output file automatically each
time it encounters one.

Text Type, Use Alphanumeric if your input document has both numbers
and letters.

^, Select Numbers Only if you are scanning financial data.

^, Select Letters Only if your input has no numbers.




Lexical Context, Select Enabled to specify that the system's language
dictionary and context rules are to be used during character
recognition. If you load a user dictionary,, it will be used,, as
well.

^, Select Disabled to prevent the system from use the system (or user)
lexicon.

^, Select No Rules to tell the system not to use either the lexicon(s)
or the context rules.

Filtering, Specify None to keep all filters off.

^, Specify Remove Halftones to have the system filter out embedded
halftone pictures and speed up recognition.

^, Specify Enhance Dot Matrix when the TIFF files contain
draft-quality dot matrix print.

Confidence Level, The Confidence Level is an assurance value that the
recognition software tries to attain for each character before it
releases it as "recognized correctly."

^, The higher the confidence level,, the greater the number of
characters that the system will flag as possibly incorrect.

Choose User Dictionary, Provide the full pathname in the provided
window of a user dictionary you want to use.

Load Language, Specify the primary language of the document being
recognized. English is the default.

Process the job

From the main window, to process the TIFF queue and have ScanWorX
recognize and convert text to the desired output format, use the
following procedure:

1.

Specify TIFF as the Input Source.

The TIFF button is highlighted.

2.

Select Text as the Process type.

The Text button is highlighted.

3.

, Note	Preserve options are only available for Interleaf and
FrameMaker formats.

8.

Click Done in the Start Processing window.

The Reading TIFF File window appears on the desktop, indi-cating that
ScanWorX is reading the first TIFF file from disk (Figure 5-11).

Figure 5-11. Reading TIFF File window

After the file is read into memory, ScanWorX displays the Start
Processing window. It recognizes the text from the TIFF page image,
and redisplays the Reading TIFF File window for each file it reads
from the TIFF Queue.

When all TIFF files from the queue have been recognized, ScanWorX
displays the Out of Input window (Figure 5-12).

Figure 5-12. Out of Input window

the document and convert the recognized text to a file formatted for
your text application, go to Step 12.

10.

Load more TIFF files on the TIFF Queue, then click Continue.

In general, you should not process more than 50 TIFF files in one
document. If you have more than 50 TIFF files from the same document,
process them as multiple jobs. Then merge the recognized text with
your text application. This should assure that ScanWorX will not run
out of memory while processing.

The system reads and recognizes the page images, then again displays
the window shown in Figure 5-12. Proceed from Step 9 to continue,
cancel, or end the document.

11.

To temporarily suspend processing, click Interrupt.

This lets you interrupt processing. You can later click Resume on the
main window and provide the filename when you want to resume
processing.

ScanWorX User's Guide

Verifying Text

ScanWorX User's Guide

ScanWorX achieves unsurpassed character recognition accuracy over a
wide range of documents.

However, certain document characteristics can cause character
recognition accuracy to decline.

For example, documents printed in ornate, thin-stroke typefaces, in
which character segments do not always connect, can cause recognition
problems (Figure 6-1).

Figure 6-1. Type quality and recognition

Documents that can also cause recognition problems are ones that
contain noise (dirt, smudges, handwritten notes in the margins); are
second- or third-generation photocopies; or which are too darkly or
too lightly printed.

To enable the best possible character recognition, even on problem
documents, ScanWorX provides interactive text verification tools
collectively called the Verifier.

The Verifier is a subsystem that enables you to view and interact with
the system's Intelligent Character Recognition to verify recognized
text, and to correct errors.

By verifying the first one or two pages of a long document, you assure
that ScanWorX will achieve an extremely high accuracy rate for the
entire document.

In addition, you can save the results of a verification session,
called verification data, in a reusable file.

Whenever you are about to process the same type of document, you can
reload this verification data file.

Thus, you attain the same high recognition rate for multiple documents
without having to repeat interactive verification for each document.

Verifying Text

This chapter describes the features of, and how to use, the Verifier
subsystem, covering these topics:

About the Verifier window

About the Verification toolbox

How verification works

Getting started

Verifying a document

Saving and loading verification data

About the Verifier Window

When you click the Verifier checkbox in the main window, ScanWorX
opens the Verifier window and toolbox (Figure 6-2).

When you initiate text recognition, the system displays and highlights
questionable characters in the Verifier window.

Figure 6-2. Verifier window; and toolbox

The large image in the Verifier window is the graphic display, a
representation of the scanned text. This is the scanned binary image
that the system "sees" and attempts to recognize.

Displayed below the graphic image is the recognized text. This text
display is usually in context with one or two adjacent words.
Characters that are questionable to the system are marked within a
gray rectangle.

The current character (the one ready for verification) is highlighted
(white type in a black rectangle).

About the Verifier Toolbox

Above the Verifier window is the verification toolbox used to perform
a variety of verification tasks (refer to Figure 6-2).

The toolbox provides nine icons that you can click with the mouse to
perform different verification tasks in the Verifier window.

Table 6-1 describes these tools and their keyboard equivalents.

Table 6-1. Verifier Toolbox

Tool, Key, Function

, R7, Accept the whole word without saving verification data.
Generally,, use this function after making corrections to a character
block that included noise.

, R8, Ignore the highlighted character group,, as it is simply noise
on the page.

, R9, Undo any operations to the previous entire group (usually a
word,, or a word with punctuation).

, R10, Move the cursor left one character within the block. Cursor is
now in overstrike mode,, and anything you type will replace the one
character.

, R11, Accept the character with verification. This informs ICR that
it has correctly recognized the character.

, R12, Move the cursor right one character within the block. Cursor is
now in overstrike mode,, and anything you type replaces the one
character.

, R13, Join this character (or group of characters) with the previous
character. Cursor is now in overstrike mode,, and anything typed
replaces the characters.

, R14, Accept the entire group with verification.


, R15, Join this character (or character group) with the next
character. Cursor is now in overstrike mode,, and anything typed
replaces the joined characters.

How Verification Works

During text verification, the system requests your input whenever the
recognition software is uncertain of a character, or cannot identify a
character at all.

In the Verifier window, uncertain characters are emphasized in both
the graphic display and the text display.

The questionable character is black in the graphic display. At the
same time, in the text display, the related character is in reverse
video (Figure 6-3).

Figure 6-3. Character ready for verification

During recognition, the system decides that an image segment is one of
several things:

A correctly recognized character

Noise (not a character at all)

A questionable character

An illegible character

The Verifier provides tools that let you deal with any one of these
types of recognition decisions.

Thus, you can verify that a recognition decision is correct, and if
not, use one of several methods to make the correction.

Characters that need to be verified

During character recognition, the system uses a number of methods, and
sometimes multiple passes, to determine a character's identity.

Eventually, the recognition software "releases" a character (no longer
tries to recognize it). Most characters that are released are
correctly recognized.

As Figure 6-4 shows, the Verifier marks characters that the system is
unsure about or is unable to identify. These are the characters that
need to be verified.

Figure 6-4. Characters needing verification

Some characters are released as questionable characters, ones that the
system is uncertain about. A questionable character may or may not be
correctly recognized.

In the Verifier window, a questionable character is displayed in black
within a word in the text display.

Occasionally, the system determines that an image is a character, but
is not able to recognize it. Thus, the system releases the image as an
illegible character.

In the Verifier window, the system outputs a tilde (~) character in
place of an illegible character.

In addition to questionable and illegible characters, the system
sometimes interprets an image as noise. Noise may be caused by dust, a
smudge, or some other mark on the scanned page image. However, it may
also be a poorly printed character.

The system outputs a checkerboard character in place of the image that
it interprets as noise. The system may also interpret noise as an
actual character.

As you advance through text in the Verifier window, ScanWorX
automatically stops at each questionable, illegible, and noise
character, and highlights the character (or character group) in
reverse video. In all cases, you must correct a highlighted character
group with at least one character. You cannot simply "delete" a
character.

The verification cursor begins in overstrike mode. Thus, you are able
to correct the recognition error, or you can simply accept the
character as correctly recognized. As soon as you type one character,
the system goes into insert mode, and you can insert up to six
characters to corrected the highlighted character group.

Sometimes the system releases a character as "correctly recognized"
when it is, in fact, incorrect. In the text display, such characters
show up as normal, unmarked characters. The Verifier provides tools
that let you highlight and correct these recognition errors, as well.

For example, the Verifier might show two words joined as one word. So,
you can cursor to the last character in the first word, and correct it
as "character plus space."

As you are verifying characters, you can accelerate the process with a
tool that lets you accept an entire word, or a word with accompanying
punctuation, such as quotation marks, hyphens, periods, question marks
and exclamation marks.

Confidence level

A setting available in the Document Settings window lets you adjust
the system's sensitivity to questionable characters. This setting is
Confidence Level, which accepts a number between 0 and 10, inclusive
(Figure 6-5).

Figure 6-5. Confidence level

During recognition, the system uses a number of artificial
intelligence techniques to identify a character. Based on these
techniques, the system assigns a value to each character. This is the
system's confidence level for that character.

If the assigned value is less than the Confidence Level you have
specified, the system marks the character as questionable. If the
value is greater than the specified Confidence Level, the system
releases the character as correctly recognized.

The higher the Confidence Level you specify, the more strict the
system is in releasing characters as correctly recognized. Thus,
during verification, you will generally need to verify a greater
number of questionable characters.

The lower the Confidence Level, the less strict the system will be in
releasing characters as correctly recognized. Thus, during
verification, you will generally have fewer questionable characters to
evaluate.

The default Confidence Level is 5, and this is usually fine for most
standard, good-quality documents.

However, you may want to increase the Confidence Level to 6 or 7
before you begin a verification session. This will give you more
opportunity to interact with the recognition software to insure the
best possible recognition.

You can change this setting at any time during verification.

Getting Started

With an understanding of verification features and capabilities, you
are ready to begin a verification session. This section describes how
to specify a new document and to adjust the display for verification
purposes.

The procedures in the following sections assume that your hardware and
software has been completely installed.

With those tasks accomplished, you can start ScanWorX. In OPEN LOOK,
to start the ScanWorX system from a UNIX shell tool window, type:

icr

In a few moments, the ScanWorX splash screen appears on your desktop.
Click on the splash screen and the main window appears (Figure 6-6)

Figure 6-6. Main window

Adjust the display

When verifying text, you may also want to click Feedback, which opens
the Feedback window. The Feedback window provides a contextual look at
your page.

Thus, while the Verifier focuses in on individual characters and
words, the Feedback window shows the related area of the page image
and highlights the related word.

When you open all these windows, however, you may have to adjust your
display so that the Feedback, Verifier, and Toolbox windows are
usefully positioned on your desktop (Figure 6-7).

Figure 6-7. Feedback, Verifier and Toolbox windows

All ScanWorX windows are standard OPEN LOOK windows. Thus, you can
move, layer, and resize them.

Note

Avoid resizing the main window and Verifier toolbox window, especially
downsizing them, as commands in those windows are of a fixed size.

For information on moving and resizing windows, consult the
appropriate Sun Microsystem's documentation.

Process the job

After you prepare your desktop for text verification, you can begin
processing your document. To begin a verification session, use the
following procedure.

Note

This procedure assumes that you have already opened the Verifier
window and toolbox on your desktop,as discussed in the previous
subsection.

1.

From the main window, select the Input Source.

The Verifier accepts input from the scanner or from the TIFF queue.

If the document you are processing is in the scanner, select Scanner.

Refer to Chapter 4 for complete information about loading the scanner
and scanning documents.

If the document is a group of existing TIFF files loaded in the TIFF
Queue, select TIFF.

After you select TIFF as the Input Source, you can view and edit the
TIFF Queue. For complete information about processing TIFF files from
the TIFF Queue, refer to Chapter 5.

2.

Select the Process type.

If the document you are scanning is all text, select Text.

If you want to process both text and images during this session,
select Both.

You cannot use the text verifier on graphic images, therefore, do not
select Image.

3.

Start the job.

Click the Start command in the main window.

Specify the file name, output directory, output format(s), and text
options, then click Done.

ScanWorX scans the first page (or gets the first page image from the
TIFF Queue), and begins recognition. When ScanWorX encounters its
first questionable or unrecognizable character, it displays it in the
Verifier window for verification.

4.

Go on to verify text.

Consult the next section, "Verifying a Document," for details about
using text verification tools.

In general, you only need to verify the first one or two pages of a
document to optimize Intelligent Character Recognition for that
document. You can turn the Verifier off at any time by clicking the
Verify checkbox in the main window. When you do, ScanWorX processes
the rest of the document automatically, using the verification data it
compiled from your verification session.

When ScanWorX has scanned all pages in the scanner (or read all TIFF
files in the TIFF Queue), it displays the Out of Input dialog.

5.

Process more pages, or end the document.

To process more pages, reload the scanner (or TIFF Queue), then click
Continue in the Out of Input window.

To end the document, and store recognized text to the specified output
directory and file name, click End Document in the Out of Input
window.

To save verification data, click the Save Verification Data command in
the Out of Input window. Do this before ending the document, or you
will lose the verification data. For complete information, see "Saving
and Loading Verification Data" later in this chapter.

Verifying a Document

The previous subsection summarizes the steps to process a document
through verification to completion.

While you are actually verifying the document, however, you can
perform a variety of verification tasks.

The following subsections describe how to perform verification tasks,
specifically how to:

Accept a character group

Accept a whole word

Make corrections and accept changes

Make corrections without verification

Enter foreign characters using the extended character set

Identify noise

Join characters

Undo an operation

End verification

Accept a character group

A character group is a single character or a sequence of two or more
characters that the system highlights for verification (Figure 6-8).

Figure 6-8. A highlighted character group

The most typical verification task is accepting a questionable, though
correctly recognized, character or character group. To accept a
highlighted character group, use this Verification tool:

Use the Accept Character tool when the highlighted character or
character group is correct, or after you have typed the correction.

If you prefer to use the keyboard, press R11.

The character group is confirmed and the next character group is
highlighted.

Accept a whole word

During verification, ScanWorX may display a word with a number of
questionable, although correct, character groups (Figure 6-9).

Figure 6-9. Word with multiple character groups

In such cases, to speed up the process, you can accept the entire word
without having to accept each character individually. To accept an
entire word, use the following Verification tool:

If you prefer using the keyboard, press the (R14) key.

When you do, the entire word is accepted and the next character group
is highlighted.

Make corrections and accept changes

Occasionally, the recognition software incorrectly recognizes, or is
unable to recognize, a character. In these cases, you type the correct
character(s) and accept the changes.

When the system highlights a character group in the Verifier window,
the highlight cursor is in overstrike mode. If the highlighted
character(s) are incorrect, you can simply type the correction (Figure
6-10).

Figure 6-10. Correcting a recognition error

Note that the cursor remains in overstrike mode only for the first
character in the highlighted character group. After you type the first
corrected character, the cursor goes into insert mode.

Thus, you can insert as many as six characters to correct the
highlighted character group. For example, in Figure 6-10, two
characters are needed to correct the illegible character symbol.

After you make the corrections, you can accept the character, or the
entire word, using the appropriate Verification tool:

If you prefer to use the keyboard, you can type the R11 or R14 keys,
respectively.

Make corrections without verification

Sometimes you may need to make a correction without accepting it for
verification purposes. That is, you do not want the system to consider
the correction as part of the verification data that it is compiling
for the document.

For example, a character might be incorrectly recognized because of
noise on the page, such as ink spots (Figure 6-11).

Figure 6-11. Recognition error caused by noise

In Figure 6-11, a mark on the page makes recognition of the "nd"
impossible. ScanWorX highlights this character group as illegible. You
can correct the illegible character group simply by typing the "nd"
over it.

However, because other "nd" character groups in the document are not
likely to look the same, you should not accept the correction for
verification purposes.

Rather, you should simply move on to the next character group needing
verification. To do so, you use this verification tool:

If you prefer using the keyboard, you can press the R7 key to perform
the same operation.

Identify noise

Occasionally, the recognition software mistakes a mark in the graphic
display for a character, and outputs the character in the text
display.

In such cases, you should identify the character as noise, and accept
the correction for verification (Figure 6-12). When you do, the
character is marked as noise in the text display.

Figure 6-12. Correcting noise mistaken for a character

You cannot simply delete such a recognized character, but must
identify it as noise.

To identify a character as noise, use this verification tool:

If you prefer to use the keyboard, you can type the (R8) key.

Note also that the system sometimes correctly recognizes noise as
noise and outputs the noise character.

Once you make the correction, or to validate a correct decision, you
can accept the character group or entire word with:

Join characters

Poor-quality documents sometimes have broken characters, with gaps
that cause recognition errors. One result of this is that the system
recognizes a broken character as two (Figure 6-13).

Figure 6-13. Broken characters

When the system outputs a broken character image as two characters,
you can correct this problem in the Verifier. To do so, you use the
Join Left or Join Right tool:

If you prefer to use the keyboard, use the R13 or R15 keys.

When only a part of a character image in the graphic display is black,
this indicates the need to join characters. After you join the
characters, you can type the correction and accept the change.

Insert non-keyboard characters for verification

Occasionally, you may find that a character not available from the
keyboard needs correction and verification (Figure 6-14).

Figure 6-14. Non-keyboard characters

ScanWorX uses the Sun Microsystem's character set, which is based on
the ISO (International Standards Organization) 8859/1 Character Set.

To insert a non-keyboard character, you use a key sequence that
involves the Meta ( META ) key plus a standard keyboard character. Use
the following procedure.

1.

Hold down the Meta key.

2.

Type the correct keyboard character.

See Appendix A for a complete list of character combinations to access
non-keyboard characters.

3.

Release the Meta key.

The non-keyboard character is inserted at the cursor position in the
text display of the Verifier window.

Verify text in box format

Occasionally, the system releases the image of a known character group
because it has a high degree of confidence that it has correctly
recognized the associated characters, and needs to reclaim the system
memory for other uses.

However, if the system subsequently associates the recognized
character group with a questionable character or punctuation mark, the
new character group is displayed for verification.

The system displays the group whose image has been released as a
series of boxes (Figure 6-15).

Figure 6-15. Box format

The graphic boxes represent the position and size of each letter of
the released group.

The actual text is shown in the text display, as usual.

Generally, this should rarely happen. When it does, you need only
verify the character group that is highlighted in the text display.

You can re-verify the character values associated with the boxes, but
normally this is not necessary.

Undo an operation

As you verify text, you can undo any verification operations that you
have made to a word (or a word with adjoining punctuation).

To do so, you use the Undo tool:

If you prefer using the keyboard, you can type the R9 key to undo an
operation.

When you use Undo, all changes made so far to the character group are
restored to their original state, and the highlight returns to either
the first character in the character group or the previous character
group needing verification.

End verification

When you have finished verifying the first page or two of your
document, you can process the rest of the document without using the
verifier.

The verification data that the system compiled with your help enables
the system to recognize the rest of the document with extremely high
accuracy.

To end verification, simply deselect the Verify box in the main
window. The Verifier window and toolbox close, and ScanWorX
automatically processes the rest of the document (all pages in the
scanner or TIFF files in the TIFF Queue).

The verification data generated to this point is used until the
document is finished being processed.

Refer to Chapter 4 for complete information about document scanning.
Refer to Chapter 5 for information about TIFF file processing.

If you regularly process the same type of document, you may want to
save the verification data for that document, and reuse it for later
documents. Refer to the next section, "Saving and Loading Verification
Data," for information.

Saving and Loading Verification Data

If you regularly process documents that are printed in the same
typefaces, styles, and point sizes, you do not have to perform
verification for each document.

Rather, you can save verification data from one document and reload it
each time you process the same type of document.

After you process a document, and the Out of Input window appears, you
can save the verification data to a named file.

Later, when you are ready to process another document of the same
type, you can use the Load Verification Data command.

Save verification data

The Save Verification Data command enables you to save the results of
a verification session to a named .@cs file.

To save verification data to a named file, use the following
procedure:

1.

Start a new job, and use the Verifier to compile verification data.

Usually, verifying one or two pages of a document is enough to compile
sufficient verification data.

2.

Stop verifying.

After verifying one or two pages, simply turn off the Verifier by
deselecting the Verify box in the main window.

The Verifier window disappears and processing continues without
interruption.

When you have finished processing all pages of your document, the Out
of Input window is displayed (Figure 6-16).

Figure 6-16. Out of Input window

3.

Select Save Verification Data.

The Save verification data window appears (Figure 6-17).

4.

Specify the output directory and file name.

5.

Click Save.

The verification data file is written to the specified directory with
the specified file name. Use the Load Verification Data command from
the main window to use the file for future text recognition jobs.

Figure 6-17. Save verification data window

Load verification data

After you save a verification data file, you can use the Load
Verification Data command to prepare for text recognition of another
document.

Important

Reload verification data only for a document that is very much like
the document for which the data was originally created. Documents
should use the same typefaces, type styles, and point sizes.
Otherwise, the will not be effective for the new document.

To load a verification data file, use the following procedure:

1.

Select Load Verification Data from the main window.

The Load verification data window appears (Figure 6-18).

Figure 6-18. Load Verification Data window

2.

Specify the directory that contains the verification data file.

3.

Click the Show Files command.

Verification data (.@cs) files in the specified directory are listed
in the bottom area of the window.

4.

From the list, click the file name to load.

The file name is highlighted and added to the Filename field at the
top of the window.

5.

Click the Load command.

The window closes and the verification data from the file is loaded.

6.

Start a new job (with or without the Verifier).

Typically, if you intend to load verification data, you do not need to
use the Verifier. However, you can use the Verifier to add to the
verification data loaded previously.

7.

Go on to process the document, using the specified verification data.

Important

Verification data remains loaded for the duration of the ScanWorX
session. If you process multiple documents during a session, it will
use the same verification data file until you explicitly unload it.
To unload verification data, click the Load Verification Data command
again, and from the window, click the None command.

ScanWorX User's Guide

Previewing Documents

ScanWorX User's Guide

Chapters 4 and 5 focus mainly on automatic document processing: You
load your scanner or the TIFF queue, specify document and scanner
settings, the output directory and file name, and let ScanWorX process
the document automatically.

This chapter describes previewing tools, which let you interact more
closely with ScanWorX to process documents (Figure 7-1).

With previewing tools, you can control how each page of a document is
processed. You can view a page and create text, image, and ignore
zones to identify data to be recognized and saved.

In addition, you have the option of zoning each page, or creating a
page template for all pages of the document.

Figure 7-1. Previewing tools

About the Document Preview Window

The Document Preview window opens on your desktop when you click the
Preview box in the main window (refer to Figure 7-1).

Like other OPEN LOOK windows, the Document Preview window has a
standard Frame menu.

Previewing Documents

Thus, you can move, resize, layer and close the window (collapse it to
an icon on the desktop).

Avoid resizing the Document Preview window horizontally, as you can
obscure some of its commands and tools, which have a fixed size.

Organized in three distinct sections, the Document Preview window
provides commands, a toolbox, and a preview window (Figure 7-2).

Areas of the Document Preview window are discussed in the next three
subsections.

Figure 7-2. Document Preview window

Preview commands

At the top of the Document Preview window, directly below the title
bar, are 12 commands and options.

Table 7-1 summarizes these commands. Later sections in this chapter
describe how to use them.

Table 7-1. Preview Window Commands;

Command, Function

Process, Recognizes the current page,, scans the next page of the
document (if you are using the ADF) and displays it in the Preview
window.

Scan Page, Scans a page at any time.

Interrupt, Saves all the intermediate character recognition and format
analysis files for pages of the document that have been recognized so
far. Processing of this document can be resumed later.

Cancel Page, Cancels the page being processed. All previous pages are
retained.

End Document, Converts all pages of the document that have been
recognized so far. Brings the system back to the idle mode and
recognition processing and scanning are no longer in progress.

Cancel Document, Cancels processing of this document,, removes all
temporary files,, and clears the document preview window.

Load Template, Loads a set of zones previously saved in a template
file.

Save Template, Saves the set of zones currently displayed in the
preview window to a named template file that you can reload for future
jobs.

Clear Template, Removes the set of zones and links currently displayed
in the preview window.

Dim Image, "Grays out" (de-emphasizes) the page image in the preview
window so that zones stand out better.

in. and cm., Displays the rulers at the top and to the left of the
preview area in inches or centimeters.

Preview toolbox

The toolbox is the series of icons seen near the top of the preview
window directly beneath the commands (refer to Figure 7-2).

The toolbox provides nine icons that enable you to perform a variety
of operations in the preview window.

When you click one of the toolbox icons, and move the cursor within
the preview window, the cursor takes the shape of the icon. You can
then perform the intended operation.

Table 7-2 describes the tools in the preview toolbox. Later sections
in this chapter describe how to use these tools.

Table 7-2. Preview Toolbox

Icon, Name, Function

, Edit Zone, Lets you select

, Zoom In, Zooms in on the previewed page

, Zoom Out, Zooms out on the previewed page

, Text Zone, Makes the pointer a "T" with which you can outline text
areas to be recognized

, Image Zone, Makes the pointer a paint brush with which you can
outline areas to be processed as image files

, Ignore Zone, Makes the pointer an Ignore Zone icon with which you
can outline areas to be ignored during processing

, Delete Zone, Lets you delete text zones

, Link Zones, Lets you link the order in which zones of the same type
are to be processed

, Zone Attributes, Lets you specify recognition settings for
individual text zones.

Preview window

The largest part of the Document Preview subsystem is the preview
window. This is your work area for page display and previewing tasks
(Figure 7-3).

Figure 7-3. Preview window

In the preview window, you can display a scanned page (or TIFF page
image), zoom and scroll the image, and create zones and links to
determine how the image is to be processed.

The rulers at the top and to the left of the preview window serve as
guides to page size, zone position and sizing.

When you use the Zoom In tool from the toolbox to magnify the
previewed page image, the scroll bars at the bottom and to the right
of the window let you shift the page image.

If you use the Dim Image command, the previewed page image is
de-emphasized (grayed out) so you can see zones and links more
clearly.

Previewing a Document

With previewing tools, you can display a scanned page image and
specify in precise detail how it is to be processed. You can identify
zones on the page to pinpoint text areas and graphic images, as well
as areas to be ignored.

Specifically, with previewing tools you can:

Scan and preview a page

Adjust the preview display

Specify text zones

Specify recognition settings for individual text zones

Identify image zones

Link text or image zones to specify processing order

Specify ignore zones

Zoom in and out on the page

Move and resize zones

The following subsections each describe how to perform one of these
tasks.

Preview a page

To begin a new job, and display a page image in the preview window,
use the following procedure:

1.

From the Options category in the main window, click the Preview
checkbox.

The Document Preview window opens (refer to Figure 7-2).

2.

Select the Input Source.

If you intend to scan pages, click Scanner. If you intend to use the
TIFF Queue, click TIFF.

3.

Prepare the scanner or TIFF Queue.

If your input is the scanner, refer to Chapter 2 for information about
loading pages in your scanner. Refer to Chapter 4 for complete
information about scanning.

Refer to Chapter 5 for complete information about loading the TIFF
Queue for delayed processing.

4.

Select the Process type that applies to this job.

If you want to process text only, click on the Text box in the main
window.

If want to process images only, click Image.

If you want both text and image output, click Both.

5.

Specify document and scanning settings.

For a description of document and scanner settings, refer to Chapter
3.

6.

Click the Scan Page command at the top of the Document Preview window.

The Start Processing window is displayed (Figure 7-4).

Figure 7-4. Start Processing window

7.

Specify appropriate entries in the Start Processing window, then click
Done.

The page image is scanned (or read from a TIFF file) and is displayed
in the preview window.

Adjust the preview display

As shown in Figure 7-1, the preview window initially opens at a
default size and position. However, you can use standard OPEN LOOK
tools to reposition and resize the preview window.

You can also zoom in and out on the preview display, scroll the
display (when zoomed in), and dim the page image to make zones more
clearly visible (Figure 7-5).

Figure 7-5. Adjusting the preview display

Zoom the page display

To evaluate the quality of your page image, you can zoom in on
(magnify) it. Zooming is useful, for example, to determine if you used
the right brightness setting for scanning a poor quality page.

Two zoom tools (shown below) are available from the toolbox.

To zoom in on the page display, select the Zoom In tool from the
toolbox.

Move the cursor into the preview window, point to the area of the page
that you want to magnify, and click the mouse. Each click zooms in
further on the display.

When you reach full magnification, the cursor automatically changes to
the Edit Zone tool. Click on the Zoom Out tool to zoom out
incrementally.

Scroll the page display

After you magnify the page display with the zoom tool, notice that the
scroll bars at the bottom and to the right of the preview window
become active. Thus, you can scroll the display both horizontally and
vertically.

Drag the scroll box (the darker rectangle within the scroll bar) in
either direction to shift the display.

Alternatively, click and hold any of the scroll arrows at the ends of
the scroll bars to shift the display incrementally.

The different buttons on the mouse affect the way the scroll arrows
work. For complete information about scrolling in OPEN LOOK windows,
refer to your appropriate Sun Microsystem's documentation.

Dim the image

When you create multiple zones and links on the page image, you may
find it easier to see these items if you use the Dim Image command
located in the upper right corner of the Document Preview window.

Click the Dim Image checkbox on. When you do, the page image in the
preview window is dimmed (de-emphasized).

Identify text zones

Identifying precise areas of a page to be processed is referred to as
manual page segmentation - or, more simply, as zoning. One of the
tools in the toolbox enables you to identify text zones on the
previewed page (Figure 7-6).

Figure 7-6. Text zone

Using text zones can speed up the recognition process by excluding
areas of the page not to be processedheaders, footers, and page
numbers, for example.

You can identify up to a total of 40 zones on the previewed page
(including text, image, and ignore zones).

To create a text zone:

1.

With a page displayed in the preview window, click the Text Zone icon
in the toolbox.

The mouse pointer becomes the "T" symbol icon.

2.

Draw the text zone rectangle.

Click and hold on the upper left corner of the text zone to be
defined.

Drag the mouse toward the lower right corner of the zone. Notice a
zone rectangle being drawn around the text area.

Release the mouse button when the rectangle outlines the text zone.

Use the Edit Zone tool (below) to select and edit zones.
 

The small solid boxes in the four corners of the text-zone rectangle
are handles for resizing.

Select the Edit Zone icon from the toolbox, then click and hold on any
handle, and move the mouse in any direction, to stretch or shrink the
rectangle.

To move the zone, click and hold inside the zone rectangle, and move
the mouse in any direction.

Use the Zoom In tool to magnify the page display so you can fine-tune
the edges of the rectangles for precise definition of the recognition
area. Use Zoom Out or the scroll bars to display the next area to
zone.

3.

Repeat Step 2 for each text zone.

You can create a text zone that overlaps another zone.

The last text zone created takes precedence over the zone that it
overlaps.

Any text contained in both zones belongs to the topmost zone.

Specify text zone-specific recognition settings

Without specific instructions, ScanWorX recognizes all text zones on a
previewed page with default recognition settings.

These include the text type (alphanumeric, numbers only, or letters
only); and whether to use context verification (dictionaries and
rules) during recognition.

To control how individual text zones of a page are to be processed,
you can specify zone-specific recognition settings (Figure 7-7).

Figure 7-7. Settings for individual text zones

When all text on the previewed page is generally the same type, you
can specify Document Settings in the main window for all zones. You
need not specify zone-specific recognition settings.

However, occasionally, a text zone contains a financial table, or
non-lexical text such as a parts list that includes both text and
numbers.

In the case of a financial table, you may want to specify the content
to be Numbers only and Context Verification off.

For the non-lexical parts list, you may want to specify text type as
Alphanumeric and Context Verification off.

In both cases, recognition should be faster and more accurate than
with the same recognition settings as normal text. For both types of
content, dictionary look-up is irrelevant and would only slow the
process down.

In the case of the financial table, specifying Numbers only would cut
down errors, especially in cases where certain numbers are very
similar to existing alphabet characters.

For example, "0" (zero) is similar to "O" (the capital letter), "1"
(one) is similar to the letter "l"; "5" is similar to "S; and so on.

To specify zone-specific recognition settings, use the following
procedure:

1.

Use the Text Zone tool to identify the text zone(s).

You can specify all text zones on a page before defining recognition
settings for individual zones.

2.

Select the Zone Attributes icon from the toolbox.

3.

Define zone information for a particular text zone.

Place the mouse pointer (now displayed as the Zone Attributes icon)
inside a text zone on the previewed page, then press the mouse button.
The Recognition Settings window is displayed (refer to Figure 7-7).

Specify Recognition settings, as appropriate, for the selected text
zone.

Click Done.

4.

Repeat Step 3 for each zone requiring specific recognition settings.

Identify image zones

In addition to defining text zones to be processed, you can also
identify image zones on a previewed page (Figure 7-8).

Figure 7-8. Image zones

When you process the page, each image zone is output to a separate
file that you can use with compatible OPEN LOOK applications.

Make sure that, from the main window, you select either Image or Both
as the Process type. Otherwise, image zones are not processed.

To create image zones, use the following procedure:

1.

With a page displayed in the preview window, click the Image Zone icon
in the toolbox.

The icon appears in reverse video, indicating it is selected. The
mouse pointer becomes the Image Zone icon:

2.

Draw the image zone rectangle.

Click and hold on the upper left corner of the image zone to be
defined.

Drag the mouse toward the lower right corner of the zone. Notice a
zone rectangle is drawn around the image area.

Release the mouse button when the rectangle outlines the image zone.
Handles appear in the corners of the image zone, indicating that the
zone is currently selected.

Use the Edit Zone tool (below) to select and edit zones.
 

To stretch or shrink the zone rectangle, click and hold on any handle,
and move the mouse in any direction. To move the zone, click and hold
inside the zone rectangle, and move the mouse in any direction.

Use the Zoom In tool to magnify the page display so you can fine-tune
the edges of the zones for precise definition of the image area. Use
Zoom Out or the scroll bars to display the next image area to zone.

3.

Repeat Step 2 for each image zone.

A total of 40 zones (of all types) can be created. You can create an
image zone that overlaps another zone. The last image zone created
takes precedence over the zone that it overlaps. This means that any
part of the image contained in both zones belongs to the topmost zone.

Image files zoned from a page use the document name as the base name.
Because multiple images may use the same image name, ScanWorX appends
a three-digit page number and a two-digit figure number. For example:

        base_pg001_fg01.ext

In the example, "base" is the base name, "001" is the page number,
"01" is the figure number on that page, and ".ext" is the extension
that identifies the output format (for example, ".ras" for a Sun
Raster file.)

Link text or image zones

Normally, ScanWorX processes zones on a page from left to right, top
to bottom.

The preview toolbox provides a tool that lets you link zones to force
the order in which they will be processed (Figure 7-9).

Figure 7-9. Linking zones

Thus, you can link multiple text zones to determine the order in which
the recognized text will be output to a text file.

With images, which each are output to a different file, you can
control the order in which they are processed and, by extension, the
figure numbers that are appended to image file names.

Note

You can link text zones only to other text zones, and image zones only
to other image zones.

To link two zones, use the following procedure:

1.

From the toolbox, select the Link Zones tool:

The icon is highlighted and the mouse pointer changes to the Link icon
when you move it into the preview window.

2.

Position the cursor in the zone that you want processed first.

3.

Hold down the left mouse button and drag the cursor into the second
zone.

Notice that the cursor draws a arrow from the first to the second
zone. This arrow indicates the order in which the zones are processed.

The second zone must be of the same type (text or image).

4.

Position the cursor in the second zone, hold down the left mouse
button and drag the cursor into the third zone to be processed.

Another zone link arrow is created, located from the second to the
third zone.

5.

Proceed as in Step 4 to link other zones.

Each subsequent link further defines the processing order of the
zones.

If any zones are left unlinked, they will be processed after all
linked zones.

Specify ignore zones

Occasionally, you may want to specify areas on the previewed page to
be ignored when the job is processed.

For this purpose, you can use the ignore zones (Figure 7-10).

Figure 7-10. Ignore zones

For example, in magazines, key passages from an article are sometimes
pulled out and displayed in large type in the middle of columns.

You could draw a text zone around a column and use an ignore zone to
mask the text displayed in large type.

In other cases, you might have a logo or drawing in your text. If
ScanWorX is not told to ignore such line art, it might try to process
it as text and slow down recognition.

To create ignore zones in the preview window, use this procedure:

1.

Click the Create Ignore Zone icon.

The mouse pointer is displayed as the Ignore Zone symbol:

2.

Create the ignore zone.

With the mouse, click and hold on the upper left corner of the text or
image area to be ignored.

Drag the mouse toward the lower right corner of the area. As you do
so, an ignore-zone rectangle (divided into four quarters by a thin,
solid line) is drawn around the area (Figure 7-10).

Release the mouse button when the ignore-zone rectangle fully encloses
the area to be ignored.

The small solid boxes in the four corners of the ignore-zone rectangle
are handles for resizing.

Select the Edit Zone icon from the toolbox; then click and hold on any
handle to stretch or shrink the rectangle.

Zoom in on the page display to fine-tune the edge locations of the
ignore-zone rectangle for precise cropping.

Zoom back out or use the scroll bars to scroll the display if
necessary.

You can move an ignore-zone rectangle with the mouse. To do so, click
on the Edit Zone icon, place the point of the arrow in the ignore zone
rectangle, click and drag the rectangle to the new location, and
release the mouse button.

3.

Repeat Step 2 for each ignore zone to be identified.

Process a document

After you display the first page of your document in the preview
window, you are ready to begin processing. You have two options for
processing a document. You can:

display and zone each page individually; or

set up a page template (set of zones) on the first page, and process
all pages with the same template.

With the first page of your document displayed, use the following
procedure to process the document:

1.

Create zones and perform other previewing operations, as necessary,
for the displayed page.

Refer to previous sections of this chapter for details.

To process each page individually, go to Step 2. To process all pages
with the same page template, go to Step 4.

2.

Leave the preview window open, and select the Process command at the
top of the window.

Text and/or images from the page are processed, then ScanWorX displays
the Out of Input window (Figure 7-11).

3.

Click Continue.

The next page in the scanner (or on the TIFF Queue) is displayed in
the preview window.

Proceed from Step 1 to process each additional page.

Proceed to Step 5 to end the document.

Figure 7-11. Out of Input window

4.

Click the Preview checkbox in the main window.

The preview window closes, and all pages in the scanner (or TIFF
Queue) are processed according to the same template.

When all pages are finished, ScanWorX displays the Out of Input window
(Figure 7-11).

5.

End the job.

Select End Document in the Out of Input window.

A single text file is converted and saved in the specified directory
and pathname. Image files are saved in the specified format, as well.

Saving and Loading Templates

As previous sections of this chapter indicate, the system's previewing
tools provide considerable power and flexibility in interactive
document processing.

To process a page, or all pages of a document, you can create and edit
text, image, and ignore zones, and define zone-specific attributes.

If you process multiple documents that are of the same design and
layout, you can combine the power of previewing with the system's
automatic processing capabilities. To do so, you create and reuse
template files.

Two tools of the system enable you to save a group of zones and their
attributes in a reusable template (.@tm) file, and then load the
template file before processing a job (or a page). These are:

Save Template

Load Template

These commands are available in the Document Preview window's menu
bar. In addition, the Load Template command is available in the main
window.

The following two subsections provide information about saving and
loading template files.

Save a template

The Save Template command at the top of the Document Preview window
enables you to save a set of zones (and any zone-specific attributes)
to a named template (.@tm) file.

To create and save a template, use the following procedure:

1.

Display the first page of your document in the preview window.

For instructions, refer to the section "Preview a page" earlier in
this chapter.

2.

Create zones and zone-specific attributes, as necessary, for the
document.

This is the page template that will be saved to the named template
file.

3.

From the group of commands at the top of the preview window, select
Save Template.

A window appears, enabling you to specify a target directory and name
for the template file (Figure 7-12).

Figure 7-12. Save Template window

4.

Optionally, specify a different destination directory.

The new directory appears as the current directory.

5.

Type a file name using OPEN LOOK filename conventions.

Do not add an extension.

6.

Click Save.

The window closes and the template file is written to the specified
destination directory.

Load a template

After you save one or more template files, you can reuse them when
processing other documents; series of pages within a document; or on a
page-by-page basis within a document.

The system provides access to the Load Template command in the main
window, and from the Document Preview window.

Thus, you can load a template and process a document without opening
the preview window.

To load a template file, use the following procedure:

1.

Select the Load Template command.

If you are working in the Document Preview window, select Load
Template from the top of the window.

If the preview window is closed, select Load Template from the main
window.

The Load Template window box appears (Figure 7-12).

2.

Specify the template file to load.

Type the file name directly, or locate and select a template file from
the Files list.

The Directories box lets you change the current directory, if need be.
Use the Show Files command to display the .@tm files in the new
directory.

3.

Click Done.

The page template stored in the template file is put in place for
processing.

If the preview window is open, the zones are visible in the window.

Figure 7-13. Load Template window

4.

Start a new job (with or without previewing).

Refer to "Preview a page" earlier in this chapter for information.

If you are processing pages without previewing, refer to Chapter 4,
"Scanning Documents" or Chapter 5, "Delay Processing" for relevant
information.

5.

Go on to process a page, a block of pages, or the entire document,
using the specified page template.

You can load a new template while page processing is in progress.

ScanWorX User's Guide

Tips and Techniques

ScanWorX User's Guide

Previous chapters of this manual focus mainly on overview, system
features, and procedural information.

This chapter provides pointers to get the best results from your
ScanWorX system.

Specifically, this chapter covers the following topics:

Getting the best text recognition

Tips for efficient processing

Optimizing column recognition

Interrupting and resuming a job

Text conversion in ScanWorX

Specifying zone markup in text files

Using the command line interface

Getting the Best Text Recognition

The system's Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) software achieves
a very high degree of character recognition accuracy over a wide range
of documents.

However, because documents vary in quality, you can help the system's
ICR software do the best possible job of capturing a document by
understanding how to use its functions together with the scanner.

This section offers some tips for optimizing text recognition.

Use and maintain your scanner properly

How you use and maintain your scanner can make the difference between
a successful and unsuccessful scan. Follow these tips:

Know your scanner. Refer to the Installation Guide for complete
information about your scanner.

Maintain the scanner. Keep your scanner clean and dust-free. Keep your
scanner's glass platen (flatbed) free of dirt or marks that might be
captured during scanning.

Load the scanner correctly. Make sure your document is not scanned at
an angle. This makes character recognition more difficult. When using
the document feeder, make sure paper guides are aligned properly for
the pages you are scanning (Figure 8-1).

If you are using the flatbed, make sure the page image is flush
against the platen, and is straight. Sometimes the actual image is
skewed relative to the paper it is printed on. Correct for this as
much as possible before scanning.

Figure 8-1. Page placement in the scanner

Adjust scanner brightness

During scanning, one of the most important settings affecting
successful character recognition is scanner brightness.

Tips and Techniques

As Figure 8-2 illustrates, the original documents you scan may vary
considerably in terms of the darkness of the text, the light-ness of
the background, and the amount of noise (dirt, smeared ink,
fingerprints, handwriting, and other marks) on the page.

In the Scanner Settings window, you can adjust the brightness dial to
compensate for the print quality and document background (Figure 8-3,
next page).

Try increasing the brightness level if characters on your page appear
too bold, are starting to fill in or are touching, or words are
separated by very small spaces (as in some magazines).

Recognition of documents with a lot of background noise, or with
colored backgrounds, may improve considerably by increasing the
brightness setting.

Try decreasing the brightness if characters on the page appear faint,
broken, or very thin.

Another way to tell if the Brightness setting is adequate is to
preview a page and zoom in to full resolution in the preview window.
This, in effect, lets you view the scanner output that the system
"sees" (Figure 8-3).

Figure 8-3. Preview display magnified

If the previewed image does not appear to have the proper brightness,
you can adjust the setting and rescan the document.

If you find that recognition is not improved by changing the
brightness setting, try using a photocopier to darken or lighten your
original before scanning.

Adjust for colors

All scanners have one or more colors that they do not read. These are
called drop-out colors. The drop-out color for the ScanWorX scanner is
green.

In addition to drop-out color, there may be other colors with which
your scanner has difficulty. If the text (or image) you are scanning
is colored, or is printed on a colored background, you can try
adjusting the brightness setting. If that does not work, try
photocopying the page and scanning the black and white copy.

Adjust the confidence level

Raise the Confidence Level in the Document Settings window to assure
higher accuracy in text recognition. Raising Confidence Level
instructs ScanWorX to be more thorough in its evaluation of characters
and words.

The trade-off is that the document may take longer to process.

When you raise the Confidence Level, it is also advisable to turn off
Questionable Character markup in Text Options, which is found in the
Start Processing window.

Thus, you avoid having to go into your final document and edit all the
questionable character markups that ScanWorX might leave.

Use text verification

Some documents - because of type styles, print quality, or other
factors - may be particularly difficult to recognize. In such cases,
you should use the interactive Verifier to help the system "learn"
about type characteristics.

The Verifier lets you view and interact with the system's Intelligent
Character Recognition to verify recognized text, and to correct errors
(Figure 8-4).

Figure 8-4. The Verifier

By verifying the first one or two pages of a document, you assure that
the system will achieve a higher accuracy rate for the entire
document.

Create and load a user dictionary

For a job that contains many special terms (for example, a legal
document, technical manual, and so on), you may want to create and
load a user dictionary.

A user dictionary is an ASCII file that lists technical terms not
typically found in a standard dictionary. It can greatly help ScanWorX
correctly recognize unusual terms in your document.

You can create your own user dictionaries, using the vi editor or
other text processing application on your workstation. Simply open a
new file and enter the words.

Separate each word by a space and let the editor's word-wrap feature
take effect.

Alternatively, place each word on a line by itself and end the line
with a carriage return. As you type in your list of words, make sure
of the following:

Words are separated by a space or carriage return.

Each word contains letters only; no spaces, numbers, special
characters, hyphens, or punctuation, except for apostrophes, are
allowed.

Accented letters specific to the language of the document being
scanned are okay.)

Each word is entered in lower case, except for words that are
typically capitalized or in all capital letters.

Each word contains four or more characters.

The entire file does not exceed 10,000 words.

Save the file in ASCII format in any directory on your hard disk. The
filename must end with the following identifying extension:

.@lx

To load a user dictionary from within ScanWorX, use the following
procedure:

1.

Click on the Document Settings command in the main window.

The Document Settings window is displayed (Figure 8-5).

Figure 8-5. Document settings

2.

Click the Choose User Dictionary command.

The Load User Dictionary window is displayed (Figure 8-6).

Figure 8-6. Load User Dictionary window

3.

Locate and select the user dictionary to load.

If necessary, change to the directory that contains the user
dictionary.

Type the file name directly, or use the mouse to select the user
dictionary from the file listing.

4.

 Click Load when you have selected the file.

The Load User Dictionary window closes.

Only one user dictionary can be loaded at a time. To unload a user
dictionary, click the None button in the Load User Dictionary window
(refer to Figure 8-6).

The Document Settings window is still open.

5.

From the Document Settings, make sure the Lexical Context setting is
enabled.

With the right mouse button, click and hold on the Lexical Context
setting. A pop-up menu with three selections appears:

      Enable
      Disable
      No Rules

Click Enabled.

This assures that ScanWorX will use the user dictionary during
character recognition.

6.

Click Done in the Document Settings window.

The Document Settings window closes.

7.

Go on to process your document.

Refer to Chapter 4 for scanning instructions. Refer to Chapter 5 for
information about delayed processing with TIFF files.

Tips for Efficient Processing

When you first start using ScanWorX, you may find it easier to scan a
document without adjusting the default settings. In many cases, using
the system defaults provides acceptable results.

However, if you want to get the best performance from your scanning
system, there are a few measures you can take before processing a
document:

Save and load settings file

Use ignore zones in preview

Use the Remove Halftones filter

These features can help to assure that the system processes only the
parts of a page that are essential, and processes them appropriately.

Over the course of an entire document, or multiple documents, using
these features can translate to valuable time savings.

Save and load settings files

Chapter 3 introduces the concept of settings files, in which you can
save command settings to reload and use for specific types of jobs.
For example, suppose you regularly process three different types of
documents: multiple-column newsletters; one-column reports; and
numerical spreadsheets.

Ordinarily, you would specify new settings before scanning each type
of document. However, you could save the settings for each type of job
in a settings file. The next time you have the same type of job to
process, you can load the customized settings file.

A settings file contains a snapshot of all the system's command
settings in place at the moment the file is saved.

However, seldom will two jobs be exactly alike. Therefore, even after
you load a particular settings file, you may want to fine-tune the
settings for the current job.

Refer to Chapter 3 for a description of commands and settings. Refer
to Chapters 4 through 7 for information about specifying settings to
accomplish different tasks.

To save a settings file

To prepare for and save a settings file, complete the steps in the
following procedure:

1.

Specify settings for a particular document.

Use the Document and Scanner settings commands in the main window to
select the settings.

2.

Select the Save command in the main window.

The Save Settings window appears (Figure 8-7).

Figure 8-7. Save Settings window

3.

Enter the file name and destination directory.

4.

Click Save.

The settings file of the given name is written to the specified
directory, and the Save Settings window closes.

To load a settings file

1.

Select Load from the main window.

The Load Settings window appears (Figure 8-8).

Figure 8-8. Load Settings window

2.

Locate and select the settings file to load.

If necessary, change to the directory that contains the settings file.

Click Show Files to list the settings (.@in) files in the new
directory

Use the mouse to highlight and select the settings file from the Files
list.

3.

Click Load.

The Load Settings window closes and the settings in the settings file
are put in place.

Use ignore zones in preview

Some elements on a page image can slow down recognition speed, as the
ICR software spends time analyzing them.

These include rotated text, graphics, logos, lines, handwritten notes,
smudges, and so on.

The preview toolbox provides a tool - ignore zone - that lets you
cover up unwanted text or graphics on a page and prevent the system
from trying to analyze and process the data (Figure 8-9):

In the preview window, you create ignore zones just as you create text
and image zones:

1.

Select the Ignore tool from the Document Preview toolbox.

2.

In the preview window, point to a corner of the area to be ignored.

3.

Hold the left mouse button, drag the cursor diagonally to the opposite
corner, then release the mouse button.

The ignore zone appears (Figure 8-9).

Figure 8-9. Ignore zone in preview window

Use the Remove Halftones filter

On a printed document, a halftone is made up of different-sized black
dots. Ordinarily, the system's Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR)
would spend some time trying to recognize halftones as text.

In a few moments, ICR would figure out that it was trying to recognize
a halftone and would then ignore it.

To speed up text recognition on documents that also contain halftones,
you can use the Remove Halftones filter.

With Remove Halftones selected, ScanWorX quickly scans the page image
and masks out halftones before beginning character recognition (Figure
8-10). Thus, actual character recognition is faster and more
efficient.

Figure 8-10. Remove Halftones filter

To use the Remove Halftones option, click the Document command in the
main window. Select Remove Halftones as the Filtering setting.

In the preview window, you can watch the Remove Halftones filter in
action, as halftones are automatically removed from the previewed
page.

Optimizing Column Recognition

If your document has columns of text, be sure you have chosen the
Columns option in the Document Settings window.

If you have not selected the correct setting, the system may insert
tab characters when it finds the space between columns. This slows
down performance, and can make your file extremely difficult to edit.

In such cases, it is better to rescan the job, making sure to specify
the correct column setting. (Refer to Chapter 3 for information about
the Document Settings window.)

Also, even if you do specify the correct number of columns, the
location of the columns relative to the edges of the page can affect
the systems column-recognition performance.

Normally, to calculate where columns begin and end, the system simply
takes the specified page width and divides it evenly by the specified
number of columns (Figure 8-11).

Figure 8-11. How the system locates columns

However, real-world documents differ in their left and right margin
and gutter sizes. Thus, the actual column width and positions may
differ from the system's estimate. This can slow down processing
somewhat.

Therefore, for best column recognition, you may want to use the
system's preview tools to create a zone template for the document. By
drawing zones to indicate actual column width and position, you can
optimize the system's column recognition performance (Figure 8-12).

If you decide to zone your document, rather than use the Columns
option, you must set the Columns option to 1. If you have Columns set
to 2, 3, 4, or Auto Detect, the zoning tools are dimmed (unavailable)
in the preview window.

Figure 8-12. Column template in the preview window

After you draw the zone template, you can close the preview window and
process the rest of the document. The zone template will remain in
effect for the entire document.

Alternatively, if the pages of your document vary in column position
and size you can process one page at a time and individually zone each
page.

For complete information about preview tools, refer to Chapter 7.

Interrupting and Resuming a Job

ScanWorX is capable of treating text recognition and text conversion
as separate processes. One benefit of this is the ability to
temporarily interrupt and resume the text recognition of a document
and still have all recognized text output to the same converted
document when you resume.

For example, you might be in the middle of scanning a 100-page
document when you want to leave for the day, or you suddenly need to
process a higher-priority document.

Simply choose a convenient break point, then you can interrupt the
first job and save it for later processing. You can go home or process
the higher-priority job.

Interrupt a job

There are several ways to interrupt a job. However, in all cases, you
must wait until at least the first page of the document has finished
processing. Then, you can access the Interrupt command in one of three
ways:

Wait until the scanner is empty, then click Interrupt in the Out of
Input window (Figure 8-13). All pages processed so far are included in
the interrupted output file.

Figure 8-13. Out of Input window

Click the Pause command in the main window, then click Interrupt in
the ensuing window.

If you use this method, the page currently being processed is
discarded (not included in the interrupted file).

If you are previewing, click Interrupt from the top of the Document
Preview window.

If you use this method, the page currently being processed is
discarded (not included in the interrupted file).

In all cases, the system interrupts the document and saves the
recognized text as a group of associated temporary files.

Thus, the document can be resumed whenever you are ready.

Recognized text is saved to an unconverted document file with this
extension:

.@tc

A .@tc (temporary contents) file is stored in a proprietary format
that contains recognized text, page number, page layout, and character
formatting information.

However, a .@tc file is not usable as a text processing document.

In addition to the .@tc file, other associated temporary files are
saved, which have the same document (base) name.

These include files that store the settings, verification data, and
other related information at the time you interrupted the document.

Refer to Chapter 2 for more information about file types in the
system.

See the next subsection for information about resuming a job.

Resume a job

When you are ready to resume scanning pages as part of the same job,
you can open the unconverted file and continue processing.

Select the Resume command from the main window. This displays the
Document to Resume window (Figure 8-14).

Figure 8-14. Resume window

Specify the directory and the interrupted document file name, then
click Done. When you do, ScanWorX opens the file and resumes
processing pages, either from the scanner or the TIFF Queue, as
appropriate.

For complete information about scanning, refer to Chapter 4. For
information about TIFF Queue processing, refer to Chapter 5.

Text Conversion in ScanWorX

This section discusses the ScanWorX text conversion process, provides
notes on supported text formats, and describes how to use the Convert
command.

ScanWorX provides two options for converting scanned documents to a
text format that you can use with your desktop publishing or other
text application:

specify automatic conversion when you process the document

specify the document to be saved as Format Analyzed Text, a ScanWorX
internal format

With the first option, you simply specify the final text format in the
Start Processing window (Figure 8-15).

Figure 8-15. Text formats

With the second option, recognized text is saved as Format Analyzed
Text, an unconverted document with associated .@dc and .@fa files.

Thus, you can use the Convert command to convert the document to any
of the final formats, while maintaining the document in unconverted
format.

Supported text formats

ScanWorX supports output of recognized text to five final formats, and
two proprietary formats for later conversion. Supported formats are
described here.

Text with Line Breaks

Choose Text with Line Breaks if your scanned document contains mostly
text in a simple format.

The Text with Line Breaks setting outputs end-of-line and
end-of-paragraph codes to maintain line and paragraph breaks.

In addition, all tabs used in the original document are replaced by
spaces. Therefore, if your document contains any tabular information
that you want to maintain, choose Tabs Delimited for this document.

Text Only

Choose Text Only if your document contains only text with little or no
formatting.

The Text Only setting outputs end-of-paragraph marks only. It does not
output end-of-line codes and will wrap text continually until it
reaches an end of paragraph mark. Line length (number of characters
per line) is determined by the application you use to import and edit
the scanned text.

Tab Delimited

Choose Tabs Delimited if you are scanning documents with tabular
formats, such as spreadsheets or tables.

The Tabs Delimited setting recognizes and outputs tabs in the
document. It also outputs end-of-line and end-of-paragraph codes.

FrameMaker

When you select FrameMaker as your text format, recognized text is
output to Maker Interchange Format (MIF), Frame Technology's ASCII
format with embedded markup codes.

MIF files can be imported to all versions (1.0 and beyond) of
FrameMaker on the Sun system. In addition, these files can be
transported to other computers that support FrameMaker.

Interleaf

When you select Interleaf as your text format, recognized text is
output to Interleaf ASCII Format, Interleaf's ASCII format with
embedded markup codes.

Interleaf ASCII Format files can be imported to Interleaf TPS 4.0 and
later on the Sun system.

KDOC

KDOC is a ScanWorX-proprietary interim format for eventual conversion
to CALS (Computer Acquisition and Logistics Support), and other
third-party formats.

Format Analyzed Text

Format Analyzed Text is an interim (unconverted) format for eventual
conversion to one of the five supported final formats - Text with Line
Breaks, Text Only, Tab Delimited, FrameMaker, and Interleaf.

The benefit of saving recognized text as Format Analyzed Text is that
you can use the Convert command to convert it to more than one format
(see the next subsection, "Use the Convert command," for information).

For example, you might want to convert the file to Text with Line
Breaks to use in an on-line database. Then, you could also convert it
to FrameMaker for desktop publishing purposes.

The Format Analyzed Text file remains intact on your system until you
remove it manually.

Use the Convert command

When you scan and recognize a document, you can save it as Format
Analyzed Text.

Then, you can use the Convert command to convert it to one of the
three ASCII formats, FrameMaker, or Interleaf.

To convert a Format Analyzed Text file, use this procedure:

1.

From the main window, select the Convert command.

The Convert window appears, letting you locate and select the
unconverted file to convert (Figure 8-16).

Figure 8-16. Convert window

2.

Locate and identify the unconverted file to convert.

Change the directory, if necessary, then click Show Files to list the
unconverted files in the new directory. Click on the file to insert it
in the Filename field.

3.

Specify the Text Format.

Cycle through the available options, or click the right mouse button
to display a pop-up menu with these five options:

	Text with Line Breaks
	Text Only
	Tab Delimited FrameMaker Interleaf

4.

Specify Text Options.

Click the Text Options command to display a window with Markup, Zones,
and Preserve formatting options (see Figure 8-17, next page).

Specify the options.

The full set of options is available only for FrameMaker and Interleaf
formats. Refer to Chapter 3 for a summary of text options. Refer to
the next section for a discussion of the Zones category.

Click Done. The Text Options window closes, and the Convert window
remains open.

5.

Click Done in the Convert window.

The Convert window closes and the Processing Document window appears,
indicating that the file is:

	Converting

In a moment the Processing Document window closes, indicating
conversion is complete.

6.

Proceed from Step 1 to convert the file into another format.

The Format Analyzed Text file remains intact on your system. Thus, you
can convert it as many times as necessary.

Specifying Zone Markup in Text Files

One of the primary applications of the system is to scan documents and
create text files that you can edit or import to other applications.

If you are interested in saving page layout information in addition to
the text of a document, you can specify zone markup.

For all text formats supported by the system (except KDOC and Format
Analyzed Text), Text Options in the Start Processing window provide
two settings for zone markup (Figure 8-17).

Figure 8-17. Zone settings

The Zone Marker text box lets you identify a start-of-zone string that
ScanWorX will write in the output file at points where new columns or
zones in the original hard copy begin. For example:

&lab;z>

Click the Zone Position checkbox on if you want the system to include
a zone position code to describe where each column begins on the
original page.

For example:

[190;0;167;738;t;0]

Each zone position code has six values, separated by commas and
enclosed in square brackets.

The syntax of the zone position code is as follows:

[lm,tm,w,h,t,0]

Table 8-1 describes what each of the zone position codes means.

Table 8-1. Zone Position Codes

Value, Description

lm, the distance from the leftmost edge of the original page to the
left edge of the zone,, in points

tm, the distance from the topmost edge of the original page to the top
edge of the zone,, in points

w, the width of the zone,, in points

h, the height (vertical length) of the zone,, in points

t, a fixed value set by the system

0, a fixed value set by the system

Using the Command Line Interface

The command line interface lets you invoke ScanWorX without going into
OPEN LOOK and using the standard menu system.

The command line interface is useful if you are using a batch
environment. By using a series of options, you can direct ScanWorX to
perform a number of functions.

Using the command line interface does not provide all of the
functionality of the menu-driven version of ScanWorX.

For example, if you want to write a command script that would scan 100
pages as TIFF files, recognize those pages, use a specific settings
file, and save them as an ASCII document you would enter:

icrcl -b -o filename -r -s settingsfile

The command line options are summarized in Table 8-2.

Table 8-2. Command Line Options

Option, Function

icrcl, Invokes the command line interface. For example,, icrcl -o
filename

-b, Output mode option. If this command is not used,, text is output.
If -b is used,, both text and image is output. For example,, icrcl -b
-o filename

-g, Output mode option. If this command is not used,, text is output.
If -g is used,, images are output. For example,, icrcl -g -o filename

-o, Specifies the name of the output file,, assuming standard Sun

Glossary of Terms

ScanWorX User's Guide

This glossary defines terms and concepts used in this manual. For
readers who are new to scanning and character recognition concepts,
this glossary may be useful not only as a reference, but as a primer
on scanning technology, as well.

Some definitions provided here contain terms in bold letters. This
means that these terms are also defined elsewhere in the glossary.


A

Alphabetic only - A setting that you can specify for Text Type under
the Document Settings command.

Alphanumeric - Text that has both alphabet characters and numbers.
Also a setting that you can specify for Text Type under the Document
Settings command.

ASCII - Acronym for American Standard Code for Information
Interchange, a 128-code set for representing characters and symbols in
a computer system.

Auto Detect - An option that you can specify for the Columns setting
in the Document Settings command enabling ScanWorX to correctly
recognize text on multiple-column pages with complex or irregular
layouts.

automatic document feeder (ADF) - A device that can be added onto a
flatbed scanner to automatically feed pages, one at a time, into the
scanner and then eject each page after it is scanned.

B

background - The state where a computer activity is in process without
help from the computer operator. For example, you can initiate
scanning and recognition on the ScanWorX system, then operate some
other OPEN LOOK application in the foreground. Scanning and
recognition will continue in background.

Glossary of Terms

base name - The document name that you assign to output files that are
created during text and/or image recognition. To the base name, the
system appends zone and page numbers to identify specific image files
that are created during recognition.

baseline - The imaginary line on which the bases of characters are
printed so that they align vertically on a line of text.

binary - In general, the computer number system that uses only 0 and 1
(off and on).

binary image - In the context of image data, binary refers to an image
made up of fully black ("1") and fully white ("0") picture elements
(pixels). See also line art and halftone.

bitmap - In computer memory, the bit-by-bit representation of a
scanned (or other) image.

brightness - An adjustable setting on a scanner that determines how
light or dark an image will be when scanned and processed to an output
file. The ScanWorX system lets you adjust brightness in the Scanner
Settings window to compensate for different original documents.

broken character - Any character on a printed document that is not
fully formed, for whatever reason. For example, on a laser-printed
document, some characters may appear broken because the toner
cartridge is low on toner. In character recognition, broken characters
can be difficult to recognize correctly. Thus, you can use the
Verifier to help the system recognize such characters.

byte - A group of bits treated by the computer as a single unit of
information.  In electronic publishing, a byte is often regarded as
equivalent to a single character, so that a five megabyte storage disk
may be said to store five million characters of information.

C

CALS (Computer-aided Acquisition and Logistics Support) - a long-term
project sponsored by the United States Department of Defense to
develop standards for computerized information interchange. See also
KDOC format.

carriage return - The computer (ASCII) code generated in a text file
when the Return key is pressed.

character group - A single character or a sequence of two or more
characters that the system highlights in the Verifier window for text
verification.

Choose Language - A command available in the Document Settings window
to load a language pack for recognition of text in a particular
language.

Columns - A setting in the Document Settings window to define the
number of columns in the document to be recognized.

column recognition - The capability to recognize text in multi-column
documents in proper sequence. The ScanWorX system supports column
recognition, and writes recognized text to the output file in a
single-column, galley format.

compound scanning - The process of recognizing both the text and the
images of a document simultaneously.

compressed - Data, usually image data, that has been encoded in such
as way as to reduce the amount of physical disk space that it takes
up. For example, several compression methods are available for TIFF
files, two of which are supported by the ScanWorX system: Group III
and Group IV.

confidence level - A value that the system assigns to a character
during recognition, based on a number of factors. If the assigned
value is less than the Confidence Level you have specified, the system
marks the character as questionable. If the value is greater than the
specified Confidence Level, the system releases the character as
correctly recognized.

conversion - The ScanWorX function of processing recognized text to a
formatted file that can be read by a desktop publishing, or other text
application.

D

defaults - The command settings in place when you first launch the
ScanWorX application. They are stored in a default settings file that
comes with the system.

delayed processing - A capability of the ScanWorX system whereby you
can scan page images into TIFF files, then process the text and images
from those pages at a later time.

diagonal - A type of halftone pattern supported by some ScanWorX
scanners.

Dim Image - An option in the preview window that de-emphasizes
("dims") the scanned page image in the window so that zones stand out
better.

digitize - To convert a scanned image to binary form for output and/or
storage on a computer.

dithering - In scanning, a digital process of simulating the gray
tones of an original image (photograph or color drawing) by writing
the ratio of black dots to white dots in a given area in the same
proportion as the gray tone. See also halftone.

document - In broad terms, any group of pages that represents a whole.
A document can be a one-page memo, a 20-page report, a 300-page bound
book, and so on. The term "document" is also used to refer to a
related group of TIFF files listed in the TIFF Queue, because these
TIFF files each contain a page image from a scanned document. A
document may also refer to the output file that is created as the
result of a scanning session.

document separator - A blank page or blank TIFF file used to indicate
to ScanWorX the end of one document and the start of the next
document.

dots per inch (dpi) - The number of picture elements (pixels) per inch
that a scanner takes in, or a screen or printer outputs.

drop-out color - A color that a scanner cannot scan. It varies from
scanner to scanner, and usually depends on the scanner's light source.
For example, if the scanner's light source is green, then the drop-out
color is green. The ScanWorX scanner's drop-out color is green.

E

Edit TIFF Queue - See TIFF Queue.

Enhance dot-matrix - An option of the Filtering setting in the
Document Settings window that enables the system to recognize text
printed by a draft-quality dot matrix printer.

F

Feedback window - The window that opens when you select Feedback in
the main window. It shows a graphic representation of the text
recognition process.

file extension - A string of three characters following the name of a
file, separated from the file name by a period (.).

filter - A setting that is applied to the page image before the
recognition software attempts to recognize the page. The ScanWorX
system supports a number of filter settings to improve recognition
accuracy and speed on certain types of documents.

fine dot - A type of halftone pattern supported by the ScanWorX
scanner.

Flip Document - A command in the Out of Pages window that lets you
inform ScanWorX that the pages to be processed are the reverse sides
of the pages just scanned. This enables the system to perform
automatic collation.

font - A set of type characters of a particular design and size. The
plain (roman), italic, bold, and bold italic versions of a particular
typeface in each available point size are fonts.

format - See text format and image format.

format analysis - Software in the ScanWorX system that detects the
format of the scanned document and preserves that formatting in the
output file.

forty-five degrees - A type of halftone pattern supported by some
ScanWorX scanners.

G

galley format - The single-column format in which the ScanWorX system
outputs text recognized from multiple-column documents.

gray scale - The image data that is derived when your scanner measures
the gray level of each picture element, or pixel, then stores this
information directly to a file, rather than first converting it to a
bitmap.

H

halftone - An image composed of differently-sized black dots spaced in
such a way as to simulate the different gray tones of an original
photograph or color drawing. In the Scanner Settings window, you can
specify a scanned image to be output as dithered halftone data. See
also binary image, dithering, and screen.

halftone pattern - The general arrangement of black dots (pixels) used
to simulate the continuous tones of an original photograph or other
image. The ScanWorX system supports a number of dithered halftone
patterns. See also dithering.

handles - The small, black squares at the corners of the a text zone,
image zone, and ignore zone rectangles in the preview window. By
clicking on one of these handles with the Edit Zone tool you can
resize the rectangle or zone.

Help - An option in the main window and throughout the ScanWorX
interface that lets you display general and context-sensitive
information about system commands and menu options.

hexadecimal (hex) - A number system using a base of 16.  Decimal
numbers 10 through 15 are represented by the letters A through F.  For
example, decimal 11 is represented by hexadecimal A; decimal 16 is
hexadecimal 10.

high contrast - A type of halftone pattern supported by the ScanWorX
scanner.

high gradation - A type of halftone pattern supported by the ScanWorX
scanner.

display it in a preview window where you can instruct the system
exactly how to process it.

preview toolbox - A group of iconic tools in the preview window from
which you can select to perform a variety of previewing tasks.

preview window - In the ScanWorX system, a window you can open on your
screen, in which you can display scanned pages or TIFF images before
processing them. In the preview window, you can create zones and
perform other operations to control how the information is to be
processed. You can open the preview window by selecting Preview in the
main window.

primary language - The language in which most (if not all) of a
document is printed. For example, a document printed in the English
language may contain passages in other languages; however, the primary
language is still English. The primary language of a document
determines the language pack to use for the job.

Q

questionable character - In Intelligent Character Recognition, a
character that the system is not sure has been identified correctly.

more efficient.

resolution - The degree of detail, measured in dots per inch, with
which a device can input or output an image.

resume - The ScanWorX system provides the ability to open an
interrupted document and continue processing text into that document.

rules - See language rules.

S

screen - A device used in the mechanical halftone process, wherein a
grid of a given line resolution is placed over an original image which
is then photographed with a photostatic camera. The resulting
photograph is a halftone made up of differently sized and spaced black
dots. Halftone screens come in various reso-lutions measured in lines
per inch. A 60-line screen produces a somewhat coarse image as in
newspapers. A high-quality screen (for example, a 133-line screen)
results in a more finely resolved image typical in magazines and
books. See also dithering.

scroll bars - Tools for shifting the view of the preview window,
located to the right of, and below, the window.

The latter two variations use data compression techniques for storing
image files, which tend to take up a lot of disk space.

template file - A file in which you can store zone information for
later re-use. When you preview a page and draw zones to specify how
the page is to be processed, you in effect create a page template. The
Save Template command in the preview window lets you save this
information in a named template file, so that you can use it for other
documents.

text conversion - See text format.

text format - The desktop publishing or other text file format to
which recognized text will be converted and output. The ScanWorX
system supports seven text formats, which you can specify in the Start
Processing window.

control how recognized text is formatted when it is output to a text
file. You specify Text Options in the Start Processing window.

text verification - The process of viewing the system's recognition
decisions and correcting them, if needed. See also Verifier.

text zone - In the preview window, a rectangular outline of an area of
text to be processed separately or in a specified sequence with other
text zones. See also previewing.

TIFF - See Tag Image File Format.

TIFF Queue - A proprietary ScanWorX system file in which is stored
"bookkeeping" information about TIFF files created for delayed
processing. The TIFF Queue command in the main window enables you to
prepare and edit the TIFF Queue to define TIFF files for text
recognition. Loading TIFF files on the TIFF Queue is analogous to
loading a stack of pages in your scanner's ADF.

toolbox - See preview toolbox and Verifier toolbox.

U

unconverted text file - A file in a format proprietary to the ScanWorX
system that contains raw recognized text and other data about the
scanned document.

user dictionary - In the ScanWorX system, a word-list file that you
can prepare in a certain format and load to improve character
recognition. A user dictionary can help the system better recognize
text in technical, scientific, and other atypical documents.

V

verification data file - A file that contains character recognition
data for a particular document. ScanWorX provides commands that let
you save and load verification data files, so you can quickly set up
the system for recognition of a particular type of document.

Verifier - A window and toolbox in ScanWorX that lets you view and
correct the system's recognition decisions. By doing so, you help the
system learn about a document's print characteristics, so that on
subsequent pages of the document, the system's recognition accuracy
will improve.

Verifier toolbox - Usually displayed with the Verifier window, a
window of icons that you can choose from to perform various text
verification tasks.

W


word wrap - A feature built into most word processing and text editing
applications that automatically breaks lines at word breaks so that
the person typing the text does not have to do it manually.

Z

zone - The area on a multiple-column page containing one column of
text or data. The term zone is also used in the context of previewing
operations in the ScanWorX system's preview window, wherein you
identify text zones, image zones, and ignore zones on a previewed
page.

zone markup - See Zones.

zone position code - See Zone.

Zones - A setting for some text formats to have the conversion
software output a markup code containing column position (coordinate)
information as reflected in the original document.

Error Messages

ScanWorX User's Guide

Occasionally, during ScanWorX operation, you may receive an error
message. ScanWorX error messages are designed to be self-explanatory.
You can simply correct the situation and proceed.

However, sometimes you may require more detail about the meaning of an
error message and how to correct it. This appendix lists each ScanWorX
error message, describes what can cause it, and suggests a course of
action.

The error messages that can be generated during a ScanWorX work
session are organized in seven categories, as follows:

Collating errors

Converting errors

Previewing errors

Processing errors

Reading TIFF file errors

Scanning errors

Other errors

Thus, this appendix is organized in sections with these same titles.
When you need information on a particular type of error, you can refer
directly to the related section for details.

However, first read the following section, "Correcting an Error
Condition."

Correcting an Error Condition

This section discusses the format of a typical ScanWorX error message
and discusses how to proceed in correcting an error condition.

Error messages are typically displayed in an alert window, as shown in
Figure B-1.

Figure B-1. Error message example

Error Messages

The window usually displays a general message followed by the error
category, and a description of the error condition. For example, in
Figure B-1, the error category is "while reading a TIFF file," and the
error condition is "Unable to read TIFF file."

This appendix is organized in sections titled by error category. Thus,
you can consult the section for information about the error. Table B-1
(facing page) describes the categories of errors.

Most errors that are generated by ScanWorX during a work session are
self-explanatory.

Usually, you can simply read the message in the dialog, click Confirm,
correct the error condition, and proceed with the task at hand.

When you encounter an error that is not self-explanatory, or that you
cannot seem to correct, consult this appendix in the appropriate
section.

Table B-1. Error Categories

Category, Related to

Collating, the system's automatic collation capability,, wherein pages
scanned out of order can be output in the correct sequence in the
recognized text file

Converting, the ScanWorX text conversion process,, wherein recognized
text is converted to the specified output format

Previewing, the ScanWorX previewing capability

Processing, the ScanWorX text recognition process

Reading TIFF file, the ScanWorX TIFF reader

Scanning, the ScanWorX scanner interface

Other, All other error messages that do not fall in one of the seven
categories listed above


Generally, this appendix provides suggestions for correcting error
conditions.

If all else fails, and you cannot correct the error condition, call
Xerox Imaging Systems Technical Support at:

   (800)-777-5350

If you should need to call XIS Technical Support, be ready to provide
the following:

your software registration number (the serial number on your original
ScanWorX tape cartridge)

the "While" message and description of the error message

a description of the steps that led up to the error condition.

Subsequent sections of this appendix describe actual error messages.

Collating Errors

The errors in this section are related to the system's automatic
collation functions.

Sorry an error occurred while collating. Invalid page number. You must
specify a new page number by changing the `Next Page' setting in the
Document Settings window

This error typically results when you are scanning the reverse sides
of a two-page document, and the Next Page number in the Document
Settings window is incorrect.

The page number should be one greater than the last odd page number
processed.

Converting Errors

The errors in this section are related to the ScanWorX conversion
process.

Sorry an error occurred while converting: Source document does not
exist

You have tried to open an unconverted document that is somehow
corrupted.

You should never get this error. If you do, call XIS Technical
Support.

Sorry an error occurred while converting: Document parsing error, bad
format analysis file

ScanWorX tried to open an unconverted document whose associated .@fa
or .@dc file is corrupted.

You should never get this error. If you do, call XIS Technical
Support.

Sorry an error occurred while converting: Format conversion system
error

This error occurs when the conversion software within ScanWorX
terminates as a result of a file permission condition or an unknown
system error.

Consult your system administrator. If you cannot resolve this problem,
contact XIS Technical Support.

Sorry an error occurred while converting: Unexpected end of file

ScanWorX tried to convert an unconverted document whose associated
.@fa file is corrupted.

You should never get this error. If you do, call XIS Technical
Support.

Previewing Errors

The errors in this section are related to the system's previewing
functions.

Sorry an error occurred while previewing: Link is invalid

You are trying to link two zones that are not of the same type (for
example, a text zone with an image zone). ScanWorX will beep twice
when you try this. On the third try, it displays this message.

Sorry an error occurred while previewing: Maximum number of zones has
been reached. Maximum number is 40

You are trying to create more than 40 zones in the preview window,
which is the maximum allowed. ScanWorX will beep twice when you try
this. On the third try, it displays this message.

Processing Errors

The errors in this section may occur while the system is recognizing a
document.

Sorry an error occurred while processing: Could not read language file

ScanWorX tried to recognize a document with a corrupt language file.

You may have to reinstall your software. If you get this error
message, contact XIS Technical Support.

Sorry an error occurred while processing: Could not read verification
data

ScanWorX tried to read a corrupt verification data file while
processing a document.

Do not use this verification data file for future jobs.

Sorry an error occurred while processing: Could not read .@fa/@tf file

ScanWorX tried to read an unconverted document that is somehow
corrupted. You should never get this error. If you do, call XIS
Technical Support.

Sorry an error occurred while processing: Could not open .@dc file

ScanWorX tried to read an unconverted document that is somehow
corrupted. You should never get this error. If you do, call XIS
Technical Support.

Sorry an error occurred while processing: Could not read the template
file

You have specified a template file for which you do not have read
permission. Consult your system adminstrator.

This message may also occur because the template file is in some way
damaged.

Sorry an error occurred while processing: Could not write the template
file

ScanWorX is attempting to save a template file to a directory for
which you do not have write permission. Use another directory, or
consult your system administrator.

Sorry an error occurred while processing: Out of memory

This error may occur when you are processing a very large document, or
a document that has a very complex layout from page to page. ScanWorX
is unable to obtain any more memory (or swap space) from your Sun
system.

XIS recommends that you have your Sun system configured with at least
22Mb of swap space. Check with your system administrator to assure
that your system is configured with this amount.

In general, XIS recommends that you do not process more than 50 pages
at a time. If your document is longer, you should process it as
multiple jobs, and merge the files with your text application. This
will assure that you do not lose data that has been scanned.

Sorry an error occurred while processing: &lab;1008,1007>

These errors may occur when you are processing a very large document,
or a document that has a very complex layout from page to page, and
there is not enough swap space on your system. Check with your system
administrator to assure that your system is configured with 22Mb (or
more) of swap space.

In general, XIS recommends that you do not process more than 50 pages
at a time. If your document is longer, you should process it as
multiple jobs, and merge the files with your text application. This
will assure that you do not lose data that has been scanned.

If you get one of these errors, make note of the number and call XIS
Technical Support.

Sorry an error occurred while processing: Unable to process image

You are attempting to process an image that is too large.

Sorry an error occurred while processing: File system error or out of
disk space

During a process, ScanWorX could not write the output file. This is
most likely because there is some file permission problem. It may also
be caused because you are out of disk space.

Consult your system administrator.

Reading TIFF File Errors

The errors in this section are related to the TIFF reader in ScanWorX.

Sorry an error occurred while reading TIFF file: Unable to read TIFF
