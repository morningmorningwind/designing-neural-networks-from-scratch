       I.  INTRODUCTION

1.      A year ago the United Nations, its Member States and the peoples
of the world recognized that a new opportunity had presented itself.
The cold war being over, the United Nations could play the pivotal role
in establishing world order and progress that had been assigned to it by
the drafters of the Charter.

2.      The past 12 months leave no doubt that the opportunity has been
grasped in a positive way.  The vast potential of the world Organization
has been recognized and has begun to be employed in the establishment of
a more stable world order:  as a strengthened voice for the poorest
countries, as deliverer of humanitarian relief, as guardian of human and
minority rights, as rescuer of States in crisis and as an instrument for
repairing a damaged global environment.  In virtually every area, as the
present report will show, there have been substantial achievements.  But
there have been serious set-backs and shortcomings as well.  This mixed
record is to be expected in view of the comprehensive agenda that we are
facing, both in quantitative terms and in the light of its complexity.

3.      Beyond the gains and losses inflicted by reality, however,
troubling questions of will and purpose have been exposed.  The pattern
of the past 12 months displays three realities:  the comprehensive
nature of the global challenge, the indispensability of the United
Nations and the gap that has been revealed as the demands of Member
States on the Organization are not matched by the resources provided.

4.      The comprehensive reality is most clearly revealed through three
objectives:  peace, development and democracy.  They are interlocking
and mutually reinforcing.

5.      In mid-1992, in my report entitled "An Agenda for Peace", I
discussed the need to view efforts for peace as a continuum over time.
From preventive diplomacy to peacemaking and peace-keeping, to
post-conflict peace-building, the cycle continues through perpetual
rounds.  Increasingly we have learned that working for peace provides us
with no place of rest.

6.      The past 12 months have demonstrated that peace operations
involve interrelated functions.  United Nations operations in the field,
most prominently in Cambodia, El Salvador, Somalia and the former
Yugoslavia, have had to range far beyond the accepted notion and
definition of peace-keeping.  Virtually every one of the departments and
established functions of the United Nations may now be involved in
operations for peace.  The second generation of peace-keeping is certain
to involve not only military but also political, economic, social,
humanitarian and environmental dimensions, all in need of a unified and
integrated approach.

7.      Development is now understood to involve many dimensions; it is
no longer merely a matter of economic policy and resources.  Political,
social, educational and environmental factors must be part of an
integrated approach to development.  Without development on the widest
scale, the young will be restless, resentful and unproductive.  People
will fight for resources, and creativity will be misdirected.

8.      A new, workable and widely agreed concept of development still
eludes us.  Until it is achieved, the United Nations will continue to
face a sequence of conflicts.

9.      There can be no flowering of development without the parallel
advance of another key concept:  democratization.  Peace is a
prerequisite to development; democracy is essential if development is to
succeed over the long term.

10.     The real development of a State must be based on the
participation of its population; that requires human rights and
democracy.  To ensure such an achievement, democratization must not only
take hold inside a State, but among States in the international
community.  And democracy within States can be fully sustained over time
only if it is linked to expanding democratization among States and at
all levels of the international system.

11.     Without peace, there can be no development and there can be no
democracy.  Without development, the basis for democracy will be lacking
and societies will tend to fall into conflict.  And without democracy,
no sustainable development can occur; without such development, peace
cannot long be maintained.

12.     And so it has become evident that three great concepts and
priorities are interlinked, and they must be addressed at every level of
human society.  We can see in recent events the relationship between the
individual, the State and the global society in which we all now
participate.  In the course of the modern era one or another of these
three has tended to be the primary focus, to the relative neglect of the
others.

13.     At one time the individual was seen as having little need for
State institutions.  At other times the State has been exalted as the
supreme object of human effort and sacrifice.  And at still other times,
the demise of the State has been predicted and an almost transcendental
globalism has been promoted as the ultimate goal of life.  We are
fortunate today to see before us, in the theatre of history, a more
integrated vision.  The individual has been reaffirmed as the creative
source of economic progress, political expression and artistic and
intellectual achievement.  States and their sovereignty are increasingly
recognized as indispensable building-blocks of international order and
problem-solving.  Cooperative global integration is now an inescapable
fact and requirement for all the world's peoples.  This is anything but
utopian; it is an effort to address compelling problems by practical
methods, to produce the cooperative community that can manage global
change.

14.     The globalization now taking place requires a profoundly renewed
concept of the State.  Between the isolated individual and the world
there must be an intermediate element, an organized community that
enables the individual to participate in the life of the world.  This
element is the State and its national sovereignty.  They respond to the
need of all human beings for identification.  In a world both impersonal
and fragmented, such a need is greater than it ever has been in
history.

15.     Individuals find identity in nations.  And nations should find
identity in universalism.  There is no international community if there
are no nations.  So the opposition between nationalism and globalization
is to a large extent false.

16.     In Chapter I of the Charter of the United Nations the founders
proclaimed the intention "to develop friendly relations among nations
based on respect for the principle of equal rights ... of peoples".
This is the foundation of a well-ordered internationalism.  National
sovereignty is the art of rendering unequal power equal.  Without State
sovereignty, the very instrument of international cooperation might be
destroyed and international organization might itself become impossible.
States are not the only actors in the international arena; they must be
part of regional associations and global organizations.  Together they
provide the framework for collective security and cooperative progress.

17.     Thus from every angle of vision, chronological, practical,
functional, conceptual, individual and institutional, we come to one
conclusion:  humanity's project is now truly universal, and to cope with
it we must fashion comprehensive and integral projects, policies and
efforts.

18.     The character of the challenges and realities I have outlined
here makes it clear that the world Organization - the United Nations -
is indispensable.  Only the United Nations has the universal character,
the global convening power and the extensive networks which cover
virtually every international function in the service of all peoples.

19.     As I have prepared this annual report on the work of the
Organization, I have tried to do so in a way that reflects the
comprehensive approach the times require.  The sections proceed from the
measures of coordination needed to strengthen the United Nations as an
organization, to the development work of the Organization, to activities
to strengthen societies against breakdown, to efforts to halt or contain
conflict, to peace-keeping operations, and peacemaking efforts, to
building for a stable future of peace.  In the new United Nations all
these aspects must be coordinated to bring them into a coherent
mission.

20.     I believe that this report provides a fair reflection of the
work carried out by the various departments of the Secretariat and by
other component parts of the United Nations system.  If the work carried
out in the economic and social sectors appears to be less focused than
the work of the Organization in the fields of peace and security, this
is, in my view, an inevitable consequence of the proliferation of
intergovernmental bodies and organizations in the economic and social
sectors and the lack of an effective coordinating mechanism.  I invite
further reflection on how that gap could be filled.

21.     It will be evident, from the detailed contents of each section
of this report, that the reach of the international community at this
time exceeds its grasp.  United Nations Forces increasingly find
themselves thrust into areas of conflict where major Powers are not
willing to venture themselves and are reluctant to make the hard choices
posed by a new era of challenges to peace.  And the United Nations is
struggling to keep a focus on development when the poorest countries no
longer hold the same interest for the rich as they did in the previous
decades of ideological competition.

22.     Yet, all too often, the eyes of the media are focused on some
aspects of the Organization's work to the exclusion of others.  As
presented in the media, the work of the United Nations appears to centre
around the multiple tasks of peace-keeping operations to the near
exclusion of other activities.  And as regards the media's concern with
peace-keeping, the operations in Somalia and Bosnia and Herzegovina
dominate reports.  One of the aims of this annual report is to correct
this distorted view of the Organization's work.  Though activities for
development may not be as glamorous as peace-keeping operations, they
are just as important and, indeed, provide the foundations for global
security and stability.  Nor are some peace-keeping operations more
important than others.  The United Nations attaches equal importance to
all conflicts.

23.     Global organizations, and especially the United Nations, are
being called upon to do a growing share of the public's international
work.  But it must always be remembered that the Member States are the
motive and supporting force of the world Organization.  Clearly, the
United Nations cannot resolve the major problems on the international
agenda in the absence of the political will, sufficient support and
continuing commitment which each particular endeavour requires.

24.     The achievements of the past year vastly outweigh the set-backs.
Common concern has become more evident and effectively expressed.  The
readiness to rely upon the United Nations is heartening and gives reason
for growing hope that the world Organization will fulfil its original
purpose and, beyond that, prove able to adapt to the new challenges of
this changing time in history.  It is my hope that this annual report,
by examining each area of action with a careful eye, will help to reveal
the areas which require far greater effort by the Member States and by
the United Nations system itself.

25.     Thus while recent accomplishments deserve great credit, they do
not provide a sense of true satisfaction.  The United Nations
renaissance remains in question.  The international community stands at
a turning-point.  There is an undeniable disparity between the vision
and the reality.  This must be faced squarely by the States Members of
the world Organization and the peoples they represent.  This report
should serve as a stimulus to greater realism, engagement, effort and
political creativity.  All are essential if the present turning-point is
to lead to a successful next stage in shaping the common future.

26.     This is the longest report of the Secretary-General to the
General Assembly on the work of the Organization in many years.  Yet it
still does not do justice to the myriad activities undertaken by the
United Nations in the course of the past year.  The necessary reform of
the Organization's Secretariat has been added to the multiplication of
tasks and the emergence of new functions demanded by the Member States.
This annual report attempts to reflect the activities of the United
Nations in as factual and comprehensive a manner as possible, yet a
detailed catalogue of our work would require a report two or three times
the size.  This report should therefore be seen as an attempt to
indicate to the Member States the scope and size of the tasks faced by
the Organization in the previous year.  In view of the growth in our
responsibilities, a burden that we willingly accept, the annual report
has grown in size and detail.

27.     My hope is that the report does justice to the men and women who
have, in the course of the year, given their time and effort in the
service of the United Nations.  The end of the cold war offers a
valuable opportunity to revitalize the international civil service.  In
this connection, the General Assembly may wish to consider whether some
personnel rules should be revised and whether the conditions of service
should be improved to attract the best qualified candidates,
particularly at the senior level, to serve in the Organization.  I would
like to see a system that rewards achievement while insisting on
accountability for inadequate performance.

28.     By presenting a comprehensive overview of the work of the United
Nations, I wish also to underscore the competence, dedication and
industry of the staff of the Organization, who have continued to give of
their best while their workload has increased substantially.  I pay
tribute to the men and women who strive to tackle some of the world's
most intractable problems with energy and creativity, sometimes paying
with their lives, and who seek to bring the world closer to the promise
of our Charter.

       attainment of these common ends".

        II.  COORDINATING A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY

        A.  Organs of the United Nations

29.     The world is being changed by powerful forces that no State, or
even group of States, has the capacity to manage by itself.  The United
Nations, as an Organization, is therefore embarking on a programme of
far-reaching reform to enable it truly to become the instrument of world
peace and development which its founders envisioned half a century ago.
No organ of the United Nations can fail to be affected by this
far-reaching reform process.

        1.  General Assembly

30.     The General Assembly is playing an increasingly practical role
in world activities.  Its workload has remained consistently heavy over
the past four sessions, with expanding activities in some areas.  The
total number of meetings held by the Assembly, its General Committee and
Main Committees each year from the forty-fourth to the forty-seventh
sessions has remained fairly constant:  436, 412, 418 and 420,
respectively.  However, the number of meetings held by working groups of
the plenary and of the Main Committees during the same period showed a
sharp increase.  During the forty-fourth session, working groups met 52
times; during the forty-seventh session, they met 77 times.  The number
of informal meetings held by the Main Committees grew in even more
dramatic proportions:  from 193 during the forty-fourth session to 313
during the forty-seventh session.

31.     Although the number of resolutions adopted by the General
Assembly during this period decreased, resolutions were increasingly
adopted without a vote or by consensus.  During the forty-seventh
session, out of 295 resolutions, 75 per cent were adopted without a
vote; by comparison, during the forty-fourth session, out of 336
resolutions, only 65 per cent were adopted without a vote (see figure
1).

32.     The expanding role of the United Nations in the area of
peace-keeping was reflected in the activities of the General Assembly.
The number of agenda items dealing with the financing of peace-keeping
and other field operations more than doubled between the forty-fourth
and the forty-seventh sessions, from 6 to 14.

33.     From the forty-fourth to the forty-seventh sessions, the
participation of Heads of State and Government in the general debates of
the General Assembly increased from 14 to 21 per cent.  During that same
period, the number of Members of the United Nations increased from 159
to 184.

34.     During the main part of its forty-seventh session, the General
Assembly considered a wide variety of issues.  The resolutions adopted
concerned, inter alia, the convening of an international peace
conference on Somalia, specific actions regarding the situation in
Bosnia and Herzegovina, and follow-up action to the United Nations
Conference on Environment and Development.  The Assembly commended the
Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production,
Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, which
has thus far been signed by 148 Member States.  The General Assembly
requested Member States to submit their views on a possible review of
the membership of the Security Council.  The Assembly also decided, as a
first step in rationalizing its work, to reduce its Main Committees from
seven to six.

35.     The work of the General Assembly could be further streamlined.
It should be noted that many resolutions, particularly but not
exclusively those affecting the economic and social areas, do not
address policy issues, but are in the nature of work programme decisions
(taking note of a report and requesting the Secretary-General to prepare
another report).  I suggest that in the interests of efficiency the
resolution format be reserved for General Assembly actions that address
policy matters and formulate recommendations for action by Member States
and the international community.  A simpler format could then be adopted
for work-programme decisions in the economic and social areas.  This
system would also bring some order of priority to the agenda of the
General Assembly.  The agenda is also in need of some rationalization.
For example, nine items on the agenda of the forty-seventh session were
not discussed at all.

36.     I should also like to suggest that, in view of the thousands of
documents produced at the United Nations each year, Member States
carefully review the need for every report.  There are many documents
requested by the General Assembly on a recurrent basis that add little
or no useful information to the report of the previous year.

        2.  Security Council

37.     In response to the new challenges to international peace and
security that have come in the wake of the cold war, the Security
Council has informally developed new working patterns even as calls have
come for changes in its formal structure.  In effect - in contrast to
years past when sessions were clearly delineated in time and topic - the
Council has found itself meeting almost continuously.  During the period
from 1 January 1992 to 31 August 1993, the Security Council held 359
sessions of consultations of the whole, totalling some 428 hours.  In
addition, the Council held 247 formal meetings, adopted 137 resolutions
and issued 144 statements by the President (see figures 2 and 3).  What
has emerged is a pattern of operations akin to that of a task force
dealing with situations as they arise, on an almost continuing basis.

38.     As a result of these changes, the Security Council is now able
to follow more closely, and in a more consistent manner than before, the
variety of security threats around the world.  But new problems have
arisen too.  It has become clear that immediate operations dealing
urgently with crises around the world need to be supported by a more
comprehensive understanding of the array of current challenges.  I
therefore favour the proposal that periodic sessions of the Council be
held at the ministerial level.  Informal consultations should be
punctuated by more formal meetings in order both to inform, and to seek
support from, the wider circle of Member States.  And communications
with other elements of the world Organization should be improved.

39.     The Security Council is in the process of rationalizing its
documentation and other procedures, while making its workings more
transparent.  In this regard, I welcome the decisions to make available
to all Member States the tentative forecast of the programme of work of
the Security Council for each month, and also to review the list of
matters of which the Council is seized with a view to rationalizing it.

40.     Pursuant to the request by the General Assembly in resolution
47/62 of 11 December 1992, I invited Member States to submit written
comments on a possible review of the membership of the Security Council.
Proposals warranting serious study are now on the table.  The question
of the Security Council's membership structure is of crucial importance,
and I look forward to the issue being resolved by the time of the
fiftieth anniversary of the Organization.

        3.  Economic and Social Council

41.     The Economic and Social Council is perhaps the organ of the
United Nations that received the least attention during the years of the
cold war.  With economic and social development firmly set as goals in
their own right, but also viewed as necessary preconditions for lasting
global peace and security, it seems clear that the Council must receive
greater attention.

42.     In my address to the Economic and Social Council at the
high-level segment of its substantive session of 1993, at Geneva on 30
June, I stressed once again the importance of the Council.  I also
repeated a proposal that I first made last year:  the Council should be
invited to provide to the Security Council reports on situations in the
economic and social areas which, in its opinion, constitute threats to
international peace and security.  I also recalled my suggestion that
the Council introduce a flexible, high-level intersessional mechanism to
respond in a timely way to new developments.  I noted that these
proposals had not received serious attention.  I take this opportunity
to reiterate them.

43.     Following discussions during the high-level segment of the
substantive session of 1992 of the Economic and Social Council, an ad
hoc working group of the Council on enhancing international cooperation
for development:  the role of the United Nations was established by the
President of the Council.  Its aim was to complete consultations before
the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly and thus to maintain
the momentum of the discussions held during the high-level segment.  I
made available to the Assembly the position papers submitted by
delegations or groups of delegations to the ad hoc working group, as
well as a compendium of position papers prepared by the secretariat of
the Economic and Social Council.

44.     At the forty-seventh session, the President of the General
Assembly established a second open-ended ad hoc working group of the
plenary on agenda item 47 (Restructuring and revitalization of the
United Nations in the economic, social and related fields) to continue
discussions.  The working group held meetings over a period of several
months.  Negotiations covered a number of significant issues, including
the membership and composition of executive boards of United Nations
programmes and funds and the financing of operational activities for
development.  The results of the group's work were officially presented
to the President of the Assembly at a plenary meeting on 25 June 1993,
immediately before the substantive session of 1993 of the Economic and
Social Council.  I am sorry to have to report that the negotiations
stalled, and that no action was taken at the meeting.

45.     At the substantive session of 1993 of the Economic and Social
Council some progress was made towards reorienting the Council's work to
the coordination of the United Nations system.  At the high-level
segment discussions devoted to the World Summit for Social Development,
the contribution of the United Nations system to social development
received considerable attention.  Concern was expressed that the system
should both be unified and function coherently.  A number of
participants expressed disappointment at the stalling of the talks aimed
at restructuring the Economic and Social Council.

46.     I remain hopeful that the efforts and good will of Member States
in pursuing the revitalization of the Economic and Social Council and
the streamlining of the responsibilities of the General Assembly and the
Council will come to fruition.  This is a window of opportunity for the
world community, a chance that may not recur.  The process of
revitalizing the work of the United Nations in the economic and social
fields, must be put back on track.  I appeal to Member States to do all
they can to that end.

47.     In the aftermath of the United Nations Conference on Environment
and Development, held at Rio de Janeiro from 3 to 14 June 1992, it has
become clear that Agenda 21 is the first international agreement
expressing a global consensus and a political commitment at the highest
levels to action on population, environment and economic advance,
encompassed in a programme of sustainable development.  The Conference
challenged Governments to adopt long-term policies on matters of the
environment and sustainable development that affect human well-being and
survival.  It further tested the willingness of nations to cooperate in
developing global strategies for the sustainable use of resources.

48.     Following the Rio de Janeiro Conference, all United Nations
agencies and bodies were required to contribute to system-wide efforts
for the realization of sustainable development, and to support
Governments in translating sustainable development policy into action.
Agenda 21 was endorsed by the General Assembly at its forty-seventh
session.

49.     The Commission on Sustainable Development held its first
substantive session at Headquarters from 14 to 25 June 1993.  Interest
in the Commission has been amply demonstrated by the active way in which
Governments have sought election to membership of the Commission, by the
number of ministers who attended the high-level segment of its first
session and by the approximately 700 non-governmental organizations that
have obtained accreditation to it.  The session clearly revealed the
strong determination of all parties involved, despite unfavourable
prevailing economic and financial circumstances, to carry out the
commitments made at the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development.

50.     This positive tone was echoed in the support expressed at the
meeting of the Heads of Government of the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (the "Tokyo Summit") in July 1993, both for
the work of the Commission on Sustainable Development and for the other
processes recommended by the Rio de Janeiro Conference.

51.     A new Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development has been
formed to ensure effective cooperation following the Rio de Janeiro
Conference.  The governing bodies of the various agencies and programmes
have taken steps to reflect the decisions of the Conference in their
work.

52.     The High-level Advisory Board on Sustainable Development
provides advice to the Secretary-General and, through him, to the
Commission on Sustainable Development and other relevant United Nations
bodies.  I have appointed its 21 members and expect the Board to hold
its first meeting in September, just prior to the opening of the General
Assembly.  The follow-up work to the Rio de Janeiro Conference is
discussed in section III of the present report.

        4.  Trusteeship Council

53.     The Trusteeship Council, in accordance with Article 86 of the
Charter, is composed of five Member States (China, France, the Russian
Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and
the United States of America).  Under the terms of Articles 83 and 87 of
the Charter, the function of the Trusteeship Council is to assist the
Security Council or the General Assembly in carrying out their
responsibilities with respect to the International Trusteeship System.
For more than 45 years, the Council has fulfilled its responsibilities,
reviewing the situation in and dispatching regular visiting missions to
Trust Territories.  This year, Palau remains the only entity under the
Trusteeship Agreement of 1947.

54.     At its sixtieth session in May 1993, the Trusteeship Council
noted that the leadership of Palau wishes to end the trusteeship at an
early date and had therefore decided to hold a plebiscite - the eighth -
on the Compact of Free Association with the United States of America.
The plebiscite, originally scheduled for July 1993, was postponed and is
now scheduled, by Executive Order of the President of Palau, to take
place on 9 November 1993.

        5.  International Court of Justice

55.     The International Court of Justice at The Hague, one of the
principal organs of the United Nations under Article 7 of the Charter
and, in accordance with Article 92, the principal judicial organ of the
United Nations, has, in the past few years, experienced a clear increase
in contentious cases as opposed to advisory opinions.  In 1993, the
Court had before it a record number of 12 cases, involving States from
nearly every region of the world.

56.     In the reporting period, judgement has been given in two cases,
and in a third case an Order indicating provisional measures of
protection has been made in record time, and hearings have been held on
the merits of two other cases.  Voluminous written pleadings have been
filed within the prescribed time-limits in the other cases.

57.     In September 1992, a Chamber of the Court, after considering
some of the most extensive pleading, both written and oral, ever
presented by Parties, gave Judgment in the case Land, Island and
Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador/Honduras:  Nicaragua
intervening), in which the complex and varied issues in dispute would
have amply justified up to eight separate cases.  In its Judgment the
Chamber drew the boundary line for each of six disputed sectors of the
land boundary.  It also decided on the legal situation of the islands in
the Gulf of Fonseca, the legal rights to the waters of the Gulf of
Fonseca, the waters outside the Gulf and the effect of the Judgment for
the intervening State, Nicaragua.

58.     The full Court, at the end of March and beginning of April 1993,
dealt with Bosnia and Herzegovina's request for the indication of
provisional measures of protection at the same time that Bosnia and
Herzegovina instituted proceedings against Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro) in the case Application of the Convention on the Prevention
and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)).

59.     As soon as possible after receiving the request and turning down
a request for postponement, the Court held a hearing at which both
Parties presented their observations.  One week later, on 8 April 1993,
the Court issued its Order, in which it called upon the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) "immediately [to] take all
measures within its power to prevent commission of the crime of
genocide".  The Court also ordered that both Parties should ensure that
no action is taken which might "aggravate or extend the existing dispute
over the prevention or punishment of the crime of genocide, or render it
more difficult of solution".  In a further Order, the President of the
Court fixed time-limits for the subsequent written procedure on the
merits.

60.     The Court in late August 1993 held hearings on a second request
from Bosnia and Herzegovina and a request from Yugoslavia for the
indication of provisional measures in the same case.

61.     Hearings in the case Maritime Delimitation in the Area between
Greenland and Jan Mayen (Denmark v. Norway) were held in January 1993.
The Court delivered a Judgment on the merits on 14 June 1993, in which
it observed that the continental shelf and fishery zones are two
separate and conceptually distinct zones for delimitation purposes.  It
noted, however, that the task for the Court, under the law applicable to
the delimitation of either zone, is to achieve an "equitable solution".
The Court, in its Judgment, divided the area of the overlapping claims
into three zones and drew the delimitation line in each of these zones.

62.     The day of the reading of the Judgment in this case was also the
opening day of the hearings in the case Territorial Dispute (Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya/Chad), which the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Chad have
presented to the Court by virtue of a special agreement.  After five
weeks of hearings, the Court is at present deliberating its decision in
that case.

63.     New cases have kept the docket crowded.  Cases on the Court's
list during 1993, other than those referred to above, are:

        (a)     Aerial Incident of 3 July 1988 (Islamic Republic of Iran
        v. United States of America).

        (b)     Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia).

        (c)     East Timor (Portugal v. Australia).

        (d)     Maritime Delimitation between Guinea-Bissau and
        Senegal.

        (e)     Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between
        Qatar and Bahrain.

        (f)     Questions of Interpretation and Application of the 1971
        Montreal Convention arising from the Aerial Incident at
        Lockerbie (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United Kingdom).

        (g)     Questions of Interpretation and Application of the 1971
        Montreal Convention arising from the Aerial Incident at
        Lockerbie (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United States of America).

        (h)     Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States
        of America).

        (i)     Gabcikovo-Nagyamaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia).

64.     The incidence of cases of considerable political as well as
legal importance shows that the Court exists not only to settle
questions of law, but is also an integral part of United Nations peace
efforts.  Seen in this context, the contentious and advisory
jurisdictions of the Court are seen to be complementary.  It is the role
of the Court as an important component of the peacemaking apparatus of
the United Nations as a whole that moved me to recommend, in "An Agenda
for Peace", that the Secretary-General might be authorized to take
advantage of the advisory competence of the Court.

65.     Under article 26, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the
International Court of  Justice, a seven-member Chamber for
Environmental Matters has been established.  The members of the Chamber
were elected by secret ballot to serve for an initial term of six months
as at 6 August 1993.

66.     There is at present a tendency to proliferate the number of
international tribunals:  for example, there are proposals for various
regional tribunals, and for tribunals to deal with environmental
disputes, with human rights issues and with the law of the sea.  It
should be borne in mind that an essential feature of international law
is that it is a single and universal system.  Accordingly, if
specialized tribunals are to be created, it may be necessary to
establish a common system for referrals of questions of law to the
principal judicial organ of the United Nations.

        6.  Secretariat

67.     The Secretariat will continue to address the challenge of
strengthening the Organization's ability to manage the 29 peace-keeping
and other field missions.  Action has already been taken to establish a
clearer definition of the respective responsibilities of the Department
of Political Affairs and the Department of Peace-keeping Operations with
regard to these operations.  The continuing effort during the coming
year will involve enhancing planning activities through greater
coordination among departments, improving budgetary planning and
financial operations, invigorating structures for audit, investigation
and programme evaluation, introducing a comprehensive staffing plan and
ensuring the security and safety of staff in the field.  Efforts will be
made to develop more standardized, systematic, expeditious and
cost-effective means of planning, launching, managing and terminating
peace-keeping operations in a changing environment.

68.     Significant improvements have been made by the introduction of
new computerized systems for field-related budget processing,
accounting, procurement and inventory control; the enhanced delegation
of administrative authority to the missions; the development of an
integrated support service in the field to facilitate the interfacing of
military and civilian components; and the establishment of new
procedures for the staffing of field missions and field-related
training.

69.     Given the extraordinary demands placed on the system by the
large number of requests for the United Nations to establish and
maintain peacemaking and peace-keeping operations, and given the
importance of deploying to the field experienced United Nations staff
for key administrative positions in general administration, personnel,
finance and procurement, the current shortage of experienced senior
administrators familiar with United Nations policies and procedures
available for assignment to these field missions will be addressed as a
matter of priority.

70.     I paid a tribute, in my introduction to this annual report, to
the staff of the United Nations.  No attempt to restructure the
Secretariat will succeed unless it takes into account its most important
asset, the staff.  I am increasingly impressed by the dedication and
professionalism of the Secretariat staff.  In this period of expansion
and restructuring, the commitment of staff members to the ideals of the
United Nations, their willingness to work long hours under difficult
conditions of service, and their flexibility to adapt to a variety of
new conditions allow us to continue the day-to-day work of the
Organization.

71.     In the course of the year, more than 1,200 members of the staff
- both Professional and General Service employees - have volunteered to
serve on United Nations peace missions.  Such missions frequently entail
a high degree of danger and stress.  Many of the functions previously
carried out by these staff members have had to be borne by employees
remaining at Headquarters, who thus have had to carry an even greater
burden.  I take this opportunity to restate my commitment to the
improvement of conditions of service for all of our staff members,
particularly with respect to personal security, salaries and career
development opportunities.

72.     Whether assigned to field missions or to other mandated
programmes, the staff must be given the tools to make this an efficient
and modern Organization.  I am determined that training, which has been
neglected in the past (when compared to other international
organizations or national services), be given the place it deserves in
management.  The proposed programme budget for the next biennium
reflects this concern.  A comprehensive programme of management
training, designed to develop leadership and managerial capacity within
the Secretariat, has been launched with a series of management seminars
for all director-level staff which will later be extended to other
management levels.

73.     Improving and updating the skills of the Organization's staff is
a significant step.  Attracting talented and qualified candidates to
join the Organization is another means of ensuring that it will be able
to respond to the challenges of the 1990s.  Although regular long-term
recruitment has been suspended owing to the requirements of
restructuring and streamlining, national competitive examinations have
provided an excellent tool for selecting the best talent available in a
given country for junior Professional positions.  Nineteen countries
will be asked to provide candidates for these examinations in 1993,
compared with 12 in 1992.  The filling of posts earmarked for these
examinations has been exempted from the temporary suspension of
recruitment.

74.     I intend to seek to improve the geographical distribution of
posts and also to secure an input of fresh talent into the Organization.
These are important considerations in the efficient management of the
human resources of the United Nations.  Equally important, we must
ensure that men and women can serve in conditions of equality.

75.     A major effort is under way to advance the standing of women in
the Organization, especially in senior-level positions.  Although it is
recognized that this is a long-term process, the policy is already
producing tangible results.  Guidelines on sexual harassment were issued
during the past year as an important part of this general effort.  It is
also necessary to develop honourable and fair procedures to terminate
the services of those staff members whose performance has failed to
fulfil the promise of earlier years.

76.     To train staff, to promote equality between men and women, and
to select top-quality candidates from Member States are three key
components of my efforts to increase the efficiency of the Organization.
Yet if the conditions of service do not remain competitive, the
Organization will lose some of its best elements.

77.     During 1993, it became clear from work carried out by the
Administrative Committee on Coordination that conditions of service of
the United Nations are steadily deteriorating.  They are losing their
competitiveness in outside labour markets and vis-à-vis other
international organizations.  The General Assembly itself acknowledged
that salary levels in a number of other international organizations
outside the common system are higher than those of the United Nations.
It is paradoxical that this should be happening at a time when many new
demands are being placed on United Nations staff.  At the request of the
Committee, this concern is being brought to the attention of Member
States and the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC).  I have
therefore decided to study with the Committee and ICSC ways to make
compensation and conditions of service competitive.  I hope that, as a
result of these studies, the Administrative Committee on Coordination
and ICSC will present specific recommendations to improve the conditions
of service of the United Nations staff by the time of the next
substantive consideration of these issues at the forty-ninth session of
the General Assembly in 1994.

78.     In this context, I must again stress the importance of a
genuinely integrated, geographically balanced, independent international
civil service of the highest calibre providing Member States with
effective and integrated support.  As part of my efforts to reinvigorate
the international civil service, to preserve the integrity and
independence of the staff, and to enhance career opportunities, I have
been studying a new approach to higher echelon appointments.  Taking
into account the views of Member States as reflected in General Assembly
resolution 47/212 B, I intend to make proposals about the senior
structure of the Organization during the forty-eighth session of the
Assembly in the context of my submission on high-level posts in the
proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995.

79.     In conjunction with streamlining in the administrative area,
internal controls and audit mechanisms have been strengthened in 1993 as
requested by Member States in different forums.  Improvements involve
better documentation of internal controls, follow-up on audit
recommendations, whether external or internal, review of the staffing of
the Division responsible for internal audits, and better planning of
audit coverage.  Improved internal controls will bring greater
managerial accountability, which is crucial for more efficient
organization.

80.     In August 1993 I announced the creation of a new post of
Assistant Secretary-General for Inspections and Investigations.  The
incumbent will head an independent Office for Inspections and
Investigations that will incorporate various units dealing with audit,
management advisory services, evaluation and monitoring, currently
within the Department of Administration and Management.  The new
Assistant Secretary-General will report directly to me and will work
closely with the Under-Secretary-General for Administration and
Management.  This appointment is the first step towards the
establishment of a higher level post with broader audit, evaluation and
investigation authority.

81.     With the implementation of the Integrated Management Information
System (IMIS), greater monitoring and audit capabilities will be
available through electronic audit trails than ever before.  IMIS is a
major step in standardizing and rationalizing the management process in
the Organization across duty stations.  The Organization will be able,
for the first time, to have access to timely, up-to-date and
comprehensive information on its resources and their utilization.  The
use of IMIS by other programmes and organizations in the United Nations
system could also promote greater transparency and compatibility of
information across organizations, leading to standardization in
administrative matters.

82.     The heightened role of the United Nations as a focus for
multilateral international dialogue has intensified the demand for
conference services in the Secretariat.  The enhanced activity of the
Security Council and its subsidiary bodies, the establishment of a
number of new intergovernmental or expert organs, and the increasing
practice of holding formal meetings and informal consultations
concurrently led to an increase of over 10 per cent in
conference-servicing workloads in 1992 and to even higher projections
for 1993.  Despite the provisions of General Assembly resolution 41/213
of 19 December 1986 on limiting conference activities, the number of
meetings, both those scheduled in the approved calendar of conferences
and those unforeseen, has continued to increase.

83.     To the extent possible, the challenge has been met with measures
to enhance productivity in conference services, mainly through the
introduction of more advanced technology and coordination with
substantive secretariats.  The need to contain conference-servicing
costs has, however, caused some interpretation and documentation
services to be curtailed.

84.     Reliance on automation to increase individual productivity is
not limited to conference services.  Most areas of the Secretariat are
undergoing significant changes in this respect.  There is greater
reliance on a global network of computers and telecommunications that
are being upgraded.

85.     Together with the reform of management practice, steps are being
taken to enhance the effectiveness of the economic and social sectors of
the Organization.  In my statement to the General Assembly on 2 November
1992, at the opening of the debate on the follow-up to the United
Nations Conference on Environment and Development, I spoke of the need
to rebuild "a unity of purpose for the economic, social and
environmental sectors of the Organization" as one of the key objectives
of my efforts.

86.     In furtherance of that objective, my aim has been to define the
functions of the various parts of the Organization and to determine how
those functions can most effectively be carried out by the Organization
itself and within the United Nations system of specialized agencies and
institutions.  The core of my managerial strategy has been to secure a
more rational distribution of responsibilities between Headquarters and
the United Nations centres at Geneva, Nairobi and Vienna, as well as
among global, regional and field structures.  This should provide a
clearer sense of purpose for each of the United Nations programmes and
sharpen the substantive focus of each of the centres.  Clear lines of
responsibility in a simpler structure, together with steps to eliminate
duplication and overlapping, will greatly improve coordination.

87.     Two broad principles govern my approach to the distribution of
responsibilities between Headquarters and other parts of the economic
and social structures of the Organization.  The first is that
responsibility for each sector or set of issues coming within the
purview of the United Nations should, to the extent possible, be clearly
assigned to, and the necessary critical mass for dealing with them
concentrated in, a single unit or entity within the Secretariat, without
duplication and as part of an organization-wide strategy.  The second,
related, requirement, is that the provision of substantive support for
central intergovernmental bodies should be regarded as a priority
activity for all economic, social and environmental entities of the
United Nations in their respective sectors, coordinated from
Headquarters.  Conversely, Headquarters capacities on cross-sectoral
issues should be placed at the disposal, and help to orient the
deliberations, not only of the central intergovernmental organs, but
also of the governing and other intergovernmental bodies in each of the
entities away from Headquarters.

88.     In proceeding to the second phase of restructuring on the basis
of these guidelines, I took careful account of the experience gained in
the first phase, which I initiated shortly after taking office early in
1992.  A key element of that phase was the establishment in New York of
a single Department of Economic and Social Development.  I saw this as a
first step, in order to create new synergies among the three pillars of
Headquarters work:  system-wide coordination and policy guidance,
research, analysis and studies on important global economic and social
issues, and technical cooperation activities in developing countries.
This initial phase of the restructuring would prepare the ground for a
second phase encompassing all of the economic and social sectors of the
Organization.

89.     The process of restructuring the work, and often the offices, of
over 1,000 people employed in the economic and social fields at
Headquarters placed considerable demands on the staff.  In the face of
these challenges, the consolidated Department of Economic and Social
Development was nevertheless able to bring about fruitful synergies
between the operational staff on the one hand, and the research and
analysis staff on the other, bringing fresh perspectives and new energy
to a number of areas of work.

90.     In the light of this experience, and taking into account the
work of a high-level panel of advisers and discussions in the General
Assembly, I took steps in December 1992 that constitute a second phase
of the reform effort in the economic and social sectors of the United
Nations.  These steps entailed the creation of three new departments
focusing, respectively, on policy coordination and sustainable
development, economic and social information and policy analysis, and
development support and management services.

91.     As a result, the balance at Headquarters between Secretariat
structures in the political, humanitarian, economic and social fields
has improved.  Organizational units now have clear and distinct terms of
reference and clear lines of responsibility, and services to central
intergovernmental bodies have been improved and integrated.  In
addition, there is now a greater capacity in terms of data and
statistical support for national as well as international policy-making,
and technical cooperation is more focused.

92.     The redeployment to New York, in the Department for Policy
Coordination and Sustainable Development, of the relevant functions and
activities of the Centre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs
at Vienna and the World Food Council secretariat in Rome should enhance
the capacity of the United Nations for coherent policy development and
provide more effective and better coordinated substantive support to
central intergovernmental bodies.  Overall, these measures will result
in a more integrated approach to development.

93.     The dispersion of different aspects of United Nations activities
in the closely interrelated areas of trade, finance, investment,
technology and services inevitably diluted the impact of these
activities.  The consolidation of these activities in the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development will eliminate these overlaps and
create a broader base for enhancing the quality of substantive support
provided to the United Nations Centre on Transnational Corporations and
the Commission on Science and Technology for Development, as well as to
the Trade and Development Board and its subsidiary bodies.  In addition,
the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat) and the United
Nations Environment Programme located at the United Nations Office at
Nairobi have been placed under common management.  This will facilitate
synergies among the two programmes and result in some savings.

94.     In 1993, the United Nations Office at Geneva has had to address
and resolve a twin problem of substance and structure.  A key priority
has been to improve the management of the Office and its responsiveness
to new demands, particularly in United Nations operational activities.
Within the United Nations Office at Vienna, the United Nations
International Drug Control Programme is responsible for confronting the
crucial problems of crime and drugs.  The United Nations Crime
Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme, also within the United
Nations Office at Vienna, has concentrated on direct support of
Governments through technical cooperation activities and training.  I
take this opportunity to restate my commitment to maintaining Vienna as
one of the principal United Nations centres.

95.     The Administrative Committee on Coordination plays a crucial
role in providing a sense of unity of purpose for the United Nations
system as a whole.  I have therefore paid particular attention to that
Committee, of which I am Chairman.  A thorough review of the workings of
the Committee and its subsidiary structure was undertaken this year.

96.     In the first instance, the functioning of the Administrative
Committee on Coordination was reviewed and a series of guidelines agreed
upon.  I intend to submit to the Committee for discussion any programme
or proposal, of a general or system-wide nature, whose significance or
content seem to me to require prior consultation with the agencies
concerned and their subsequent cooperation in follow-up and
implementation.  I shall keep the Economic and Social Council fully
apprised of the outcome of these consultations.

97.     The executive heads, as members of the Administrative Committee
on Coordination, for their part undertook to carry out the necessary
consultations within the framework of the Committee when launching, on
their own initiative, any operation - such as the organization of an
international or world conference on a subject that involves the
mandates and interests of a number of United Nations organizations - the
implementation of which will require contributions by several or all of
the members of the Committee.  They also agreed to inform their
deliberative organs of major impending initiatives within the United
Nations system of particular relevance to their organizations or in
which their organizations are expected to participate.

98.     The complexity of the subsidiary structures of the
Administrative Committee on Coordination has been greatly reduced.  The
new structures of the Committee are centred around two consultative
committees - the Consultative Committee on Administrative Questions and
the Consultative Committee on Programme and Operational Questions - and
on the new Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development.  The new
structures will provide a forum in which policy issues affecting
system-wide aspects of the management of human and financial resources
can be discussed in a coordinated fashion.  They will also allow closer
interaction between policies and operations.  They reflect the
importance of the concept of sustainable development as an integrating
framework for the activities of the system.

99.     I am convinced that the commitments I have outlined, together
with the new spirit prevailing in the Administrative Committee on
Coordination and the specific reforms which have been introduced, will
greatly enhance inter-agency cooperation in support of development.

100.    At the same time, I must remind Member States that they, too,
have a responsibility to help to improve coordination within the system.
These responsibilities must be exercised at two levels.  First, at the
level of the central intergovernmental bodies within the United Nations
itself, Member States must develop system-wide strategies and policies
and provide effective guidelines for the work of the secretariats
represented in the Administrative Committee on Coordination.  My earlier
remarks on the reform of the Economic and Social Council are relevant in
this context.

101.    Second, Member States must take coherent and consistent
positions in the governing bodies of the various organizations.  One
glaring example of their failure to do so hitherto is the persistence of
differences in the conditions of service adopted by Member States for
the international staff serving in the Bretton Woods institutions on the
one hand, and the rest of the system on the other.  Further examples of
divergent policy directives exist throughout the spectrum of substantive
and operational issues before the various governing bodies.  The
Administrative Committee on Coordination stands ready to do its part to
help to overcome these differences and to adopt mutually reinforcing
policy stances throughout the system.

        B.  Interim offices

102.    I undertook in my last annual report to focus attention on
activities in the field and to bring greater unity to the United Nations
presence at the country level.  I have established interim offices in
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and
Uzbekistan.  My aim has been the creation of an integrated approach to
the provision of the services that the United Nations system can offer,
and the coordination of inter-agency activities in response to the
requirements of Member States.  Consultations on the establishment of
integrated offices are currently under way in Cambodia, Eritrea and the
Russian Federation.

103.    These measures are intended to facilitate access to the United
Nations system for Member States, especially newly independent States
and other States in transition, that wish to seek its assistance in
various areas of activity.  They are also intended to improve the
capacity of the United Nations to respond appropriately to the specific
socio-economic, environmental, political and humanitarian requirements
of such countries.

104.    The interim offices have already begun to play an effective role
in responding to the needs of their host Governments, both in
development activities and in supporting the transition process that
these countries are undergoing.  The interim offices have facilitated
the Organization's humanitarian and emergency relief activities.  In
those countries where I have been given a mandate to help to resolve
actual or potential conflicts, the interim offices have been of great
value as a channel of communication with the Government concerned and as
an instrument for the dissemination of information about the United
Nations.

105.    In all these activities, the interim offices have succeeded in
strengthening the image of the United Nations as an integrated system
whose component parts are able to work together, in support of host
Governments, in response to the special and urgent requirements of
countries in transition.  This has been achieved with the full
cooperation and assistance of the funds, programmes and offices of the
United Nations system.  The Administrative Committee on Coordination has
welcomed my decision to work for a more unified field presence.  The
representatives of some of the specialized agencies, which are not yet
taking part in these arrangements, have indicated a wish to be
associated with them.

106.    In devising a new model for United Nations representation in
those countries, it is not my intention to disturb or replace existing
mechanisms for coordination.  On the contrary, the intention is to build
on what has already been achieved.  I intend to apply to other
countries, as needed, the approach that is evolving in the countries
where interim offices have been established.  My aim is to develop a
more effective, unified United Nations presence at the country level.

        C.  Ensuring an adequate financial base

107.    The conjunction of the persistent difficulties of a number of
Member States in meeting their financial obligations and the
unprecedented level of expenditures for mandated activities (see figure
4) is expected to cause major financial difficulties for the
Organization by the autumn of 1993.

108.    The unprecedented growth in the demand for the services of the
United Nations has stretched financial resources to the breaking-point.
In January 1993, assessed contributions payable by Member States
amounted, in rounded figures, to $1.6 billion for the regular budget.
The cost of peace-keeping missions is expected to rise from $1.4 billion
in 1992 to an estimated $3.6 billion by the end of 1993 (see figure 5).

109.    I must report with great concern and deep regret that, owing to
the failure of many Member States to pay their assessed contributions in
full and on time, the cash flow situation, with regard both to the
regular budget and to United Nations peace-keeping operations, remains
critical.  As of 26 August 1993, only seven Member States had paid their
assessed contributions to the regular budget and peace-keeping
operations in full.

110.    If this pattern continues, the regular budget will need to
borrow internally from other funds as from September 1993.  Several
peace-keeping operations have experienced severe cash shortages.  In
order to be able to respond to the needs of these operations, temporary
advances have had to be made from the Peace-keeping Reserve Fund which
was established by the General Assembly in resolution 47/217 of 23
December 1992.  In order to meet its various other obligations,
including the payment of salaries, the Organization had to resort to a
variety of short-term measures such as borrowing from funds having
available cash.

111.    The proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995 will be
considered by the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.  It
proposes a modest growth of 1 per cent in the level of resources,
primarily in the areas of preventive diplomacy, peace operations,
peace-building, human rights and the coordination of humanitarian
assistance.  This programme budget reflects the interest of Member
States in strengthening these activities.  It is my hope that all Member
States will reach broad agreement and adopt this programme budget by
consensus as they have done in the last several bienniums.

112.    On 2 August 1993, with total cash reserves sufficient for less
than two months of operations, I decided to send an urgent letter to the
Heads of State and Government of Security Council members and of all
Member States with outstanding contributions, outlining the gravity of
the financial situation.  I stated that the financial situation was so
precarious that it threatened the capacity of the Organization to
finance new undertakings, and that even existing operations would be in
jeopardy.  On 26 August I told the Fifth Committee that the
Organization's cash flow situation had become so serious that I had been
compelled to take economy measures affecting conference services,
including the servicing of the Security Council, the General Assembly
and their committees and subsidiary bodies.  Specifically, I made it
clear that it would not be possible for meetings to be serviced, except
in emergencies, during the evening, at night or during weekends.  I also
warned that, unless there was an improvement in the situation, further
economy measures would have to follow.

113.    At my request, the Ford Foundation convened an independent
international advisory group of experts in September 1992 to examine the
financing of the United Nations, with a view to creating a secure
financial base for the Organization over the long term.  The group met
three times between September 1992 and January 1993 and published its
report, entitled "Financing an Effective United Nations", in February
1993.  The report is comprehensive and contains many valuable
recommendations.  I should like to take this opportunity of expressing
my profound thanks and appreciation to the chairmen and members of the
group for their work, and also to the Ford Foundation for sponsoring it.
I have sent the report to Member States and am also transmitting it to
the General Assembly for consideration at its forty-eighth session.

114.    In spite of these unfavourable circumstances, indeed partly
because of the strained cash situation, the Administration has pursued
its efforts to enhance its productivity.  The increased productivity of
the United Nations during the past year is reflected in the remainder of
this report.

        D.  Preparing for the fiftieth anniversary

115.    The Preparatory Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the
United Nations, established by the General Assembly in decision 46/472
of 13 April 1992, held five meetings.  Agreement was reached by
consensus on a theme for the anniversary:  "We the peoples of the United
Nations ... united for a better world".  The Preparatory Committee also
established a working group to prepare a solemn declaration for the
observance.

116.    To date, 13 Member States have notified me of the formation of
national committees in support of this observance.  I look forward to
receiving confirmation from other Member States regarding their national
committees.  The fiftieth anniversary secretariat has been coordinating
anniversary preparations and programme development within the system,
with the support of non-governmental organizations and other partners.
I regard the anniversary as a major milestone to be marked not only by
celebration, but by programmes of serious reflection, education and
communication.

        III.  DEVELOPING THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY

117.    The gap between the world's richest and poorest countries is
widening, yet that shocking fact is more often than not greeted by
indifference.  The United Nations is the special voice of the world's
poorest nations.  No task is greater or more urgent than to impress upon
the economically leading nations that the world cannot ultimately
prosper if the poorest continue to suffer and decline.

118.    The ideological contest of the cold war stimulated great
super-Power interest in developing countries.  The reasons were not
always admirable, but poor countries could benefit from that interest.
Today, we see that the world, in the wake of the cold war, recognizes
the importance of competition; but the end of the cold war has ended the
competition to bring development to the world.

119.    The message from the United Nations has been clear:
macroeconomic growth should not be pursued without due consideration for
such aspects of human well-being as health, education, poverty levels,
income levels and income distribution, and participation in the
political process and in the market place.  In short, human development,
in its social and economic dimensions, must be at the centre of all
development efforts.

120.    I intend to set out the United Nations approach to development
in full in "An agenda for development", a preliminary report which will
be submitted to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.  An
agenda for development will provide more than yet another development
theory.  As a practical document, it will set the guidelines for future
United Nations action in the economic and social fields.  I look forward
to a lively and fruitful discussion of the preliminary report during the
forty-eighth session.

        A.  Global development activities

        1.  Secretariat departments at Headquarters

121.    The Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable
Development provides substantive support for the central coordinating
and policy-making functions vested in the Economic and Social Council in
its high-level, coordination and operational activities segments and the
Second and Third Committees of the General Assembly, the Commission on
Sustainable Development, the Commission for Social Development, the
Commission on the Status of Women and, pending the conclusion of the
current intergovernmental review, the World Food Council.  The
Department serves, at the expert level, the High-level Advisory Board on
Sustainable Development and, at the inter-secretariat level, the
Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development and other subsidiary
bodies of the Administrative Committee on Coordination dealing with both
operational and programme questions.  The Department will coordinate the
contributions of other Secretariat entities to the work of central
intergovernmental bodies in the economic and social areas, but its aim
is also to broaden the base and improve the quality of support by
engaging all relevant parts of the economic and social sectors of the
Organization.

122.    The Department will assist me in ensuring the successful
implementation of Agenda 21 and other major documents adopted at the
United Nations Conference on Environment and Development.  Considerable
efforts will need to be made to ensure that sustainable development
principles are adequately reflected in new or adjusted policies, in
legislation, and in programme budgets and structures.

123.    The redeployment to this Department of the relevant functions
and activities of the Centre for Social Development and Humanitarian
Affairs at Vienna and the World Food Council secretariat at Rome should
enhance United Nations capacity for coherent policy development and
provide more effective support for central intergovernmental bodies.  It
should, in general, help to promote a more integrated approach to
development.

124.    The Department, in addition to providing subject-specific policy
reports, as required, for the relevant intergovernmental bodies, will
assume primary responsibility for the preparation of an annual policy
report of the Secretary-General focusing on a selected number of major
policy issues calling for concerted international action.  That report
will draw on, and be coordinated with, the work of the Department for
Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis, the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development and other concerned entities.

125.    I have also asked the Department for Policy Coordination and
Sustainable Development to take on responsibility for coordinating the
preparations for the World Summit for Social Development, to be held at
Copenhagen in 1995.  The Summit, which will coincide with the fiftieth
anniversary of the Organization, is already the focus of much debate
within the United Nations system, particularly within the Economic and
Social Council.  Preparatory studies for the Summit are under way, on
some of the major economic and social issues facing the international
community.  They include:

        (a)     Poverty, and equity issues, both inter-State and
        intra-State;

        (b)     Unemployment, vulnerable groups and countries, and
        patterns of economic exclusion;

        (c)     Social security issues and safety nets;

        (d)     Migration and patterns of human and economic movement.

126.    With respect to the advancement of women, my objective is to
achieve a stronger and more unified programme.  The relocation of the
Division for the Advancement of Women within the Department for Policy
Coordination and Sustainable Development will place its activities in
the mainstream of the economic and social work of the Organization, and
should assist in integrating gender issues into every aspect of our work
on development.  My proposal to merge the International Research and
Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW) with the
United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) has been endorsed by
the Economic and Social Council.  It should give greater coherence to
the policy, research and operational aspects of United Nations efforts
for the advancement of women.

127.    Taken together, these measures should help to focus preparations
for the Fourth World Conference on Women, to be held at Beijing in 1995.
Other preparatory work for that important global forum has involved
support for national and regional preparations, the coordination of
United Nations system participation, the involvement of non-governmental
organizations, and efforts to heighten public awareness.  The
Secretary-General of the Conference, Gertrude Mongella, has already
conducted missions to several States Members of the United Nations to
promote the goals and objectives of the Conference, and to seek support
for it at all levels.

128.    The question of violence against women has continued to be of
deep concern.  A major step forward was the drafting of the draft
Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which the
Economic and Social Council, at its substantive session of 1993, urged
the General Assembly to adopt.  It is hoped that this work will be
brought to a successful conclusion at the forty-eighth session of the
Assembly.
        *  *  *

129.    The Department for Economic and Social Information and Policy
Analysis has a central responsibility for maintaining and enhancing the
quantitative information systems (population and statistics) of the
United Nations.  In addition, the Department is charged with servicing
the substantive needs of the international community in the fields of
economic and social policy and research.  It thus provides the link
between the various departments and organs at Headquarters and the
regional commissions.

130.    The Department also serves as the lead unit for economic and
social information within the United Nations and provides statistical
support to all parts of the Organization.  In this regard, it will
cooperate closely with the Bretton Woods institutions and other relevant
organizations and will link its activities with the early-warning
capabilities being developed in the political and humanitarian sectors
of the Organization.

131.    Since its inception in February 1993, the Department for
Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis has concentrated on
the development and implementation of the 1993 System of National
Accounts and on providing a new impetus for the collection of statistics
on the environment.  The Department has also undertaken considerable
preparatory work for the International Conference on Population and
Development, to be held at Cairo in September 1994, for which, together
with the United Nations Population Fund, it is providing the
secretariat.  In addition, two reports were made available to the
Economic and Social Council at its substantive session of 1993, namely,
the 1993 Report on the World Social Situation and the World Economic
Survey, 1993.  Those reports were the culmination of more than a year of
intensive efforts.  Their basic structure and approach were worked out
under the authority of the head of the former Department of Economic and
Social Development.

132.    The Statistical Commission, and the Economic and Social Council
at its substantive session of 1993, adopted the 1993 System of National
Accounts, a basic tool for organizing and analysing economic statistics.
With the adoption of the 1993 System, an international consensus was
reached on an up-to-date and near-universal language for economic
dialogue among countries and groups of countries.  The adoption also
marked the successful culmination of a 10-year effort by the Secretariat
on the System of National Accounts, which was carried out in close
collaboration with the regional commissions, the International Monetary
Fund, the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development, the European Community and many national experts.

133.    Fresh impetus was given to work on environmental statistics.
The development and implementation of integrated environmental and
economic accounting will provide new tools for monitoring in this field.
Further pioneering work on gender statistics continued, with a second
issue of The World's Women in preparation.  Priorities and an action
plan were established from a global review of international statistical
activities designed to improve international cooperation and statistical
development with an enhanced regional dimension.

134.    The work of the Secretariat in population aims to facilitate the
work of the Economic and Social Council, through the Population
Commission, in the formulation of policy recommendations, in the
delivery of technical assistance and cooperation and in the substantive
coordination of the activities of the United Nations system in the field
of population.

135.    The implications of the Single European Act for countries not
members of the European Community, including the transitional economies
and the developing countries, were explored in two issues of the Journal
of Development Planning.  Another issue of the same journal was devoted
to examining the implications for developing countries of the economic,
political and social transformations in central and eastern Europe.

136.    Macroeconomic forecasts of the world economy for the period
1993-2001 and alternative policy simulations were prepared to serve as
the basis for policy-oriented discussions at expert group meetings held
at Ankara, Geneva and New York.
        *  *  *

137.    The Department for Development Support and Management Services
is designed to sharpen the focus of United Nations technical assistance
and enhance its impact on the priority needs of developing countries and
countries in transition.  The new Department's mandate is twofold.  On
the one hand, it will act as an executing agency for programmes and
projects relating to institutional and human resources development in
areas such as development planning, policies and infrastructure, public
administration, private sector development and enterprise management,
financial management and accounting, and natural resources and energy
planning and management.  On the other hand, the Department will be the
focal point at United Nations Headquarters for the provision of
management services and implementation functions for technical
cooperation.

138.    With effect from 1 January 1994, the Department will
incorporate, as a semi-autonomous entity, the Office for Project
Services, currently located within the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP).  One consideration in making this change was the view,
frequently voiced by Member States, that the current location of the
Office within UNDP is incompatible with the primary purpose of UNDP as a
central coordinating and funding mechanism.  The change should also
increase cost-effectiveness and eliminate duplication in the delivery of
technical cooperation services by the United Nations.  The incorporation
of the Office for Project Services in the Secretariat also provides an
opportunity for the redeployment, closer to the constituencies they are
intended to serve, of relevant parts of the Organization's technical
cooperation and advisory services.

139.    The Department for Development Support and Management Services
has, since its creation in 1993, concentrated on the thematic and
cross-sectoral aspects of its work.  Special attention has been paid by
the Department to the integration of its activities with the
Organization's work in peace-keeping and humanitarian affairs.  Ongoing
activities in this area include support for election administration and
reconstruction efforts in a number of countries, and work on the
conversion of military infrastructure and industries to peaceful
civilian use.

140.    The Department has taken part in the new UNDP support costs
arrangements, and in discussions with the executing agencies and UNDP
about how the system could be refined to make it more effective.

141.    The Department for Development Support and Management Services
is also giving close attention to ensuring that it plays a dynamic role
as an agent for technical cooperation, particularly in the context of
national execution and the programme approach.  It has intensified its
efforts in institution-building and human resource development, with
particular attention to the strengthening of institutions in developing
countries.  The Department is also implementing a multisectoral approach
to technical cooperation and institution-building.

        2.  United Nations Conference on Trade and Development

142.    In the area of international trade, the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has focused on issues
related to national transparent mechanisms in the context of the fight
against protectionism.  UNCTAD has also stressed the need for
international support for the initiatives of developing countries,
especially through improved market access and stronger financial flows.
The link between the decreasing real price of primary commodities and
the environment has been addressed in Agenda 21.  Depressed commodity
prices lead to overproduction to maintain foreign exchange income, a
process which often leads in turn to environmental deterioration.

143.    The concept of comprehensive development has had a major impact
on the work of UNCTAD.  Whereas in the past proceedings were usually
geared to the adoption of resolutions and decisions, the reforms adopted
at the eighth session of UNCTAD, in February 1992, have led to an
increasing role for negotiations.  The pragmatic and non-confrontational
approach implicit in those reforms has facilitated the search for
convergence and consensus-building.  On the other hand, unless
opportunities for trade and development are enhanced, tensions will
build up and confrontational approaches will once again come to the
fore.

144.    The Special Committee on Preferences conducted an extensive
exchange of views on the implementation of the generalized system of
preferences and agreed to undertake a policy review of the system in
1995.  Recent agreements reached by negotiations held under the auspices
of UNCTAD include the International Sugar Agreement (March 1992), the
Protocol extending the International Agreement on Olive Oil and Table
Olives, 1986, with amendments (March 1993), and a new Convention on
Maritime Liens and Mortgages (May 1993).

145.    UNCTAD has enhanced its capacity to address the new challenges
and opportunities that have arisen for strengthening international
cooperation for development.  Furthermore, with the imminent transfer to
UNCTAD from United Nations Headquarters of programmes relating to
transnational corporations and science and technology for development,
the UNCTAD secretariat will be well placed, through improved programme
delivery, to enable the concerned commissions of the Economic and Social
Council, as well as the competent UNCTAD intergovernmental bodies, to
discharge their respective mandates more effectively.

        3.  United Nations Environment Programme

146.    The new leadership of the United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP) has the responsibility of transforming its programme in
recognition of Agenda 21 priorities.  The seventeenth session of the
Governing Council was held in May 1993.  That was the first
intergovernmental meeting to discuss Agenda 21 since its endorsement by
the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session, and it provided an
opportunity for Governments to agree on programmes and priorities
affecting both the developing and the developed countries.

147.    In supporting the implementation of Agenda 21, the Governing
Council called upon the Executive Director to make every effort to
strengthen, orient and adjust, as appropriate, the activities,
programmes and medium-term plan of UNEP to help achieve the objectives
of Agenda 21.  After receiving and reviewing in detail the UNEP
programme for the bienniums 1992-1993 and 1994-1995, the Council noted
that the programme would require further development to incorporate
changes required by the Rio de Janeiro Conference.  The Governing
Council reaffirmed that Agenda 21 must be implemented in close
cooperation with the Commission on Sustainable Development, and
requested the Executive Director to present to the Council at its next
session her estimates of the costs to UNEP of the full implementation of
those parts of Agenda 21 specifically recommended for the Programme's
attention.  The Council stressed that high priority should be given to
the needs of developing countries.

148.    UNEP provided technical cooperation in the field of
environmental law and institutions to the Governments of 11 African, 10
Asian and Pacific and 3 Latin American and Caribbean countries.  That
work was conducted in cooperation with UNDP, the World Bank and regional
organizations.  In addition, national environmental plans and strategies
were prepared in 14 developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin
America.  Country studies on costs and benefits of environmental
management and conservation of biodiversity were carried out in six
countries with different biological profiles.

149.    The international environmental information system of UNEP now
brings together a total of 155 participating countries.  About 25,000
queries were answered in 1992.  The INFOTERRA International Directory
contains over 6,000 sources of environmental information.  Equipment and
training were provided to 30 developing countries.  The Global Resources
Information Database (GRID) has now linked 30 affiliated centres around
the world.  This enables planners and scientists to access data, monitor
trends and study the interactions between environmental variables using
geographic information systems and data management computer techniques.
The Global Environmental Monitoring System (GEMS) set up a regional
environmental information network to promote the exchange of
environmental information in support of strategies for collective
preventive or remedial action on environmental issues.  Regional surveys
were conducted to identify environmental and natural resources
information and information management requirements and activities in
the African, Asian-Pacific and Latin American regions.

150.    UNEP provided assistance, through joint undertakings with the
regional commissions and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations, to seven countries for the formulation of national plans
to combat desertification.  Support was also provided, jointly with
other organizations, to establish networks and mechanisms for mobilizing
action for the implementation of the Plan of Action to Combat
Desertification.  Through the UNEP/UNDP joint venture, the United
Nations Sahelian Office continued to assist Sudano-Sahelian countries to
implement the Plan of Action and to bring together additional financial
and technical assistance from other bodies.  In addition, UNEP
cooperated with regional and subregional organizations, such as the
Southern Africa Development Community and the Arab League, to provide
assistance through them to their member countries in the implementation
of the Plan of Action.

151.    UNEP is cooperating closely with African Governments,
non-governmental organizations and development agencies in the
implementation of the programme of the Conference of African Ministers
on the Environment, in the area of energy and food security, and on
measures to strengthen environmental machineries, the formulation of
environmental action plans and programmes, and environmental training
and public awareness.  UNEP continues to emphasize in its outreach
programme the topic of women and the environment.

152.    UNEP is providing support for 24 projects under the Action Plan
for the Environment in Latin America and the Caribbean, including the
initial financing of the secretariat, located at the UNEP regional
office for Latin America and the Caribbean.  Those projects are being
implemented in close association with Governments, the Economic
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, regional offices of
specialized agencies and other intergovernmental agencies and
subregional organizations.

153.    UNEP is also working closely with its partners UNDP and the
World Bank to increase efficiency in the implementation of the Global
Environment Facility (GEF).  UNEP is strengthening its scientific inputs
and servicing of the Science and Technology Advisory Panel.  UNEP is
also taking an active part in the evaluation of GEF-funded projects and
in discussions on the administration, legal framework and management of
the next phase of GEF.

154.    The range and variety of these programmes indicates the
difficulty of acting coherently and comprehensively; clearly the level
of integration which we seek and which the times demand has not yet been
attained.  A substantial effort has, however, been made and progress
over the past year has been evident.

        4.  United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat)

155.    The global housing crisis, which affects hundreds of millions of
families in both rural and urban settlements, and the social, economic
and environmental impact of the unprecedented pace of urbanization in
the developing regions provide the context of the work of the United
Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat).

156.    The main policy direction for the activities of the Centre
derives from the Global Strategy for Shelter to the Year 2000, adopted
by the General Assembly in December 1988.  It has also been incorporated
into the human settlements programme of Agenda 21.  The Strategy
encourages Governments to adopt policies that enable all the actors in
the public and private sectors, including non-governmental
organizations, community organizations and women's groups, to contribute
to the process of improving shelter and human settlements conditions,
and provide adequate mechanisms to monitor progress through quantitative
and policy indicators.

157.    Similarly, the applied research and training activities of
Habitat have focused on improving the capacity of Governments,
especially at the local level, and low-income communities to face the
challenges of human settlements management and development.  Equally
important is the identification of low-cost and environmentally sound
technological options for human settlements infrastructure and services.
Directly addressing the critical need to make an early contribution to
the continuum of relief, rehabilitation and development activities of
the United Nations system, Habitat has also played a notable role during
the year in human settlements and rehabilitation efforts in Afghanistan
and Cambodia.

158.    The decision by the General Assembly at its forty-seventh
session to convene a second United Nations Conference on Human
Settlements (Habitat II) in 1996 is a clear recognition of the need for
new concerted action by the international community to address the
issues of environmentally sustainable human settlements development in a
rapidly urbanizing world.  Habitat, which will provide the secretariat
for the Conference, will have a major responsibility for the success of
the Conference, in cooperation with Member States and the United Nations
system.

        B.  Operational activities for development

159.    Discussions on the reform of operational activities have been
under way in the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council
since 1989.  In 1992, in an important step forward, the General
Assembly, in resolution 47/199, reaffirmed the need for reform in the
field of development activities.  It also stressed that development is a
shared responsibility.  The Assembly urged developed countries to
increase their official development assistance, and emphasized that
recipient Governments had the primary responsibility for coordinating,
on the basis of national strategies and priorities, all types of
external assistance.  Resolution 47/199 also contained important
guidelines on the role of the United Nations system in development.  The
country strategy note, introduced by the resolution, offers a major
opportunity for coordinating the response of the entire United Nations
system to the priorities of developing country Governments.  The
programme approach is another important feature of resolution 47/199,
and will play a major role in securing logical and integrated donor
responses to government development priorities at the sectoral and
intersectoral levels.  Under resolution 47/199, the United Nations is
required to assist Governments to achieve self-reliance in managing
their economic and social development.

            1.  Technical cooperation programmes of the United Nations
                Secretariat

160.    In 1992, the then Department of Economic and Social Development
had 918 technical cooperation projects under execution, with a total
delivery of $141 million, against current year budget provisions of $185
million.  The work programme of the Department consisted of giving
advice and assistance to developing countries in national economic and
social development planning, and providing expertise on energy policy,
water resources projects, mineral resources, cartography, remote sensing
and infrastructural work, public administration and finance, statistics,
population policies, and transnational corporations, in addition to
support services for other development agencies.  The Department also
participated in programmes relevant to the notion that political
progress and economic development are inseparable and must be pursued
simultaneously.

161.    A large-scale effort to assist in the national election held in
Angola, in September 1992, focused on the coordination of foreign
assistance and on logistical support.  Other electoral missions were
conducted in Albania, Ethiopia, Mali and Mozambique.  Missions were also
fielded to provide advice and assistance in preparing elections in El
Salvador, Lesotho, Rwanda and Uganda.  In this, the Department and,
since December 1992, the Department for Development Support and
Management Services, worked closely with the Electoral Assistance Unit
in the Department of Political Affairs.

162.    The Department of Economic and Social Development, with the
cooperation of the Beijing Commission for Science and Technology,
organized at Beijing, in October 1992, a seminar on urban information
systems and their application to developing countries.  The purpose of
the seminar was to provide a forum for discussion and dissemination of
current and improved techniques in this field.

163.    The Department provided secretariat services and technical
background papers for the Sixth United Nations Conference on the
Standardization of Geographical Names.  In collaboration with the Earth
Observation Satellite Company and the International Society for
Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, the Department organized a two-week
seminar on photogrammetry and remote sensing, to benefit developing
countries.

164.    I have followed with particularly close interest and concern the
question of African development and the implementation of the United
Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, adopted
by the General Assembly in its resolution 46/151, as updated by the
System-wide Plan of Action for African Economic Recovery and
Development.  The goals and activities of the New Agenda were central to
the work programme of the Office of the Special Coordinator for Africa
and the Least Developed Countries in 1992.  To advise and assist me in
this work I appointed a panel of high-level personalities.  I took part
myself in meetings of the panel, at Geneva in December 1992 and at Rome
in May 1993.  I am most grateful to the members of the panel for their
valuable contribution, which is ongoing.

165.    The Department of Economic and Social Development organized, in
cooperation with the INSTRAW, an interregional workshop on women's role
in the environment and sustainable development in September 1992 at
Beijing.  There were 120 participants and over 80 prototype project
proposals were developed.  The workshop was perceived as providing a key
link between the Rio de Janeiro Conference and the Fourth World
Conference on Women, to be held in 1995.  The Department also organized,
in cooperation with INSTRAW and the Economic and Social Commission for
Asia and the Pacific, a regional workshop on training modules on women,
water supply and sanitation, which was held in Thailand in September
1992, following a similar one held in the Gambia in 1991.  The
Department also responded to requests about developing national
databases and reports for the 1995 Conference.

        2.  United Nations Children's Fund

166.    In 1992, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) cooperated
in programmes in over 130 countries.  In addition, UNICEF expanded its
programmes of support to central and eastern Europe and the republics of
the former Soviet Union as mandated by the Executive Board.  Programme
expenditure totalled $744 million in 1992.  Of that amount, 31 per cent
was spent on child health, including the expanded programme on
immunization and oral rehydration therapy; 22 per cent on emergency
programmes; 15 per cent on planning, advocacy and prime support; 11 per
cent on water supply and sanitation; 10 per cent on education, including
young child development; 7 per cent on community development, women's
programmes and children in especially difficult circumstances; and 4 per
cent on nutrition and household food security.

167.    Overall UNICEF expenditure for 1992 was dominated by emergency
assistance, owing partially to the situations in Angola, Iraq,
Mozambique, Somalia, the Sudan and the former Yugoslavia.  For the
biennium 1992-1993, the estimated expenditure of UNICEF amounts to $1.8
billion.  It is forecast that the total annual income of UNICEF will
exceed $1 billion by 1995.  Expenditure on emergency relief is expected
to decrease, with a corresponding increase in expenditure on the
development aspects of the work of UNICEF, including child health and
nutrition, water supply and sanitation, education, community
development, children in especially difficult circumstances and
women-centred programmes.

168.    The goals established by the international community for UNICEF
include seven overarching goals and a number of supporting goals.  The
overarching goals include reduction of infant mortality by one third or
to 50 per 1,000 live births, whichever is the lower; reduction of
mortality among children under five years old by one third or to 70 per
1,000 live births; reduction of the maternal mortality rate by half by
the year 2000; reduction of severe and moderate malnutrition among
children under five by half by the year 2000; universal access to safe
drinking water and to sanitary means of excreta disposal; universal
access to basic education and completion of primary education by at
least 80 per cent of children of primary school age by the year 2000;
reduction of the adult illiteracy rate (the appropriate age group to be
determined in each country) to at least half its 1990 level, with an
emphasis on female literacy; and improved protection of children in
especially difficult circumstances.  Among the supporting goals, key
items include eradication of polio by the year 2000; elimination of
neonatal tetanus by 1995; elimination of guinea-worm disease by the year
2000; virtual elimination of iodine deficiency disorders and vitamin A
deficiency; and access by all pregnant women to basic maternal care.

169.    Since the World Summit for Children, some 142 countries have
embarked on national programmes of action, often developed with UNICEF
support.  The World Summit for Children captured the essence of UNICEF
support and advocacy when it affirmed the principle of a "first call for
children", which it defined as "a principle that the essential needs of
children should be given high priority in the allocation of resources,
in bad times as well as in good times, at national and international as
well as at family levels".  This was a logical consequence of the
mandates given to the Organization in relation to the goals for children
and development and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

170.    In June 1993, children addressed the World Conference on Human
Rights at Vienna and demanded greater respect for the rights of
children.  A number of national programmes of action have been drawn up
by developed countries.  They include activities for their own children,
and commitments on assistance to children in developing countries.  In
developing countries, the national programmes of action have outlined
strategies and priorities for budget allocations and provided a
framework for the mobilization and coordination of development
assistance.

        3.  United Nations Development Programme

171.    The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is the largest
provider of grant assistance for technical cooperation in the United
Nations system.  It serves over 170 developing countries and territories
through its network of 124 field offices.  UNDP coordinates operational
activities for development for the United Nations system as a whole and
works closely with the regional commissions, the Secretariat and the
specialized agencies, and with the Bretton Woods institutions.  At the
country level, the head of each UNDP office is the Resident
Representative, who is usually designated as the resident coordinator of
the United Nations system's operational activities for development, and
is also the local representative of several other United Nations
organizations and programmes.  Work has continued on the integration of
18 United Nations information centres with UNDP field offices, in such a
way as to preserve the functional autonomy of the centres.

172.    UNDP expenditure has increased considerably over the last 10
years (see figure 6).  Over the past five years, UNDP has funded
programmes and projects valued at around $7 billion.  The resources of
UNDP derive from voluntary contributions received from developed and
developing countries alike.  Those external resources support national
programmes in which the major share is allocated by the countries
themselves.  In 1992, the largest share of spending was in Africa (39
per cent), followed by Asia and the Pacific (33 per cent), Latin America
and the Caribbean (7 per cent), the Arab States (7 per cent) and Europe
and the Commonwealth of Independent States (2 per cent).  The remainder
was spent on interregional and global programmes, for the support of
national liberation movements, and in Caribbean and Pacific multi-island
programmes.  In each region, some 87 per cent of UNDP resources went to
least developed countries (those with a GNP per capita of less than $750
per year).

173.    The bulk of UNDP-funded activities fall within the framework of
country programmes through which UNDP and the recipient Government spell
out the strategy for using UNDP resources effectively.  Compared with
earlier cycles, the country programmes approved for the fifth
programming cycle are more focused on the priorities outlined in
Governing Council decision 90/34, namely, poverty alleviation,
management of development, environment and natural resources management,
women in development, technical cooperation among developing countries
and science and technology for development.  Also emphasized are
HIV/AIDS, education for all, and private sector development.  UNDP is
experienced in both long-term technical cooperation and emergency and
transitional situations.  The HIV/AIDS epidemic is a major natural
disaster of planetary scope, with particularly devastating consequences
for developing countries.  Since 1987, UNDP has provided funds to some
30 countries for national HIV/AIDS-related programmes.  While continuing
to show concern for those infected, UNDP, in close cooperation with the
World Health Organization, has stressed the importance of preventive
measures for combating the pandemic.

174.    In 1992 the number of projects aimed at fostering self-reliance
through capacity-building for sustainable human development increased.
Those projects included guiding the development process to reach the
poor and alleviate poverty; protecting the environment and regenerating
the resource base for future production; designing workable strategies,
action plans and policy reforms; mobilizing financial resources, both
public and private; and managing the aid process to help countries make
the most of limited concessional resources.  The aim of UNDP was to help
countries develop economies that would achieve job-led growth and
increase social equity and integration.  Increased attention to human
development has led to a greater recognition of the importance of the
political, social, cultural, environmental and institutional aspects of
development previously overshadowed by the focus on economic factors.
There is now a growing acceptance that development cooperation must
include measures to improve governance, judicial systems and social
integration and other activities designed to remove obstacles to real
participation.  This was the theme of the Human Development Report 1993,
which UNDP sponsored.

175.    Developing countries sought specific UNDP support to apply the
human development concept in national strategies.  Since there is no
blueprint for human development, each country has taken its own course,
focusing on different issues and priorities.  In each case, commitment
is critical, from Governments and non-governmental sectors alike.  Areas
of concern for the national strategies have included the collection of
data on development gaps and disparities, analysis, and building
consensus between policy makers and representatives of civil society,
particularly between non-governmental organizations and the private
sector.  The aim is to offer multidisciplinary approaches to social
justice in a sustainable manner.

176.    The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development
gave UNDP a particular mandate to support countries in their efforts to
build capacity to implement Agenda 21.  Together with the United Nations
Environment Programme and the World Bank, UNDP manages the $1.3 billion
Global Environment Facility (GEF), taking responsibility for
capacity-building and targeted research projects, preinvestment
activities, the GEF small grants programme for non-governmental
organizations, and facilitating in-country coordination and
dissemination of information.

177.    Development activities are now clearly seen as helping to
establish the conditions for peace.  In the aftermath of conflict,
developing countries are asking UNDP to assist them with the
rehabilitation of war-torn areas, the return and resettlement of
refugees and the demobilization and training of former soldiers.  To
create conditions likely to maintain peace, countries seek UNDP support
for programmes to build their capacities to reconstitute the social
fabric and to ensure that people can meet their basic needs.

178.    At the same time, requests for assistance in fields relatively
new for UNDP are being received as Governments seek to give people a say
in the forces that shape their lives by increasing their participation
in political processes.  Support is increasingly sought to improve
abilities to conduct elections, bring about democratization and ensure
legal protection and human rights.  In 1992 in Africa alone, UNDP
contributed about $2 million to electoral assistance projects in eight
countries that drew nearly $32 million in funds from the countries
themselves and from bilateral donors.  Countries turned to UNDP for
assistance in these sensitive areas, showing their confidence in the
objectivity, neutrality and effectiveness of UNDP.

179.    UNDP has coordinated its activities with those of the
multilateral financial institutions, including the Bretton Woods
institutions and the regional development banks.  The comparative
advantages of UNDP include its field-based organization constantly in
touch with local realities, its delivery of technical cooperation for
capacity-building, and its effective and extensive cooperation with the
specialized agencies.  The collaboration includes joint activities at
global and regional levels and the execution by multilateral financial
institutions of UNDP-funded projects at interregional, regional and
national levels.

180.    UNDP cooperation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has
focused on assisting developing countries to build their capacity for
sound macroeconomic policy formulation and management and establishing
necessary financial institutions.  For the most part, IMF has acted as
executing agency for UNDP-funded projects.  In addition, there have been
joint training programmes in macroeconomic adjustment and the design of
structural adjustment programmes.

181.    At the regional and global levels, many development issues
require the mobilization of resources, expertise, research networks,
forums for debate and media presentation on a massive scale.  UNDP has
worked with the World Bank and the donor community in many areas of
global concern, including the Global Environment Facility, the Energy
Sector Management Assistance Programme, the International Drinking Water
Supply and Sanitation Decade, the Urban Management Programme, the
Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research and the
Onchocerciasis Control Programme.  At the regional level, there are such
joint activities as the African Capacity-building Initiative, the Social
Dimensions of Adjustment and the National Long-term Perspective
Studies.

182.    In "An Agenda for Peace", I highlighted the role of regional
organizations in peacemaking and preventive diplomacy.  That role
extends naturally across the spectrum of political, economic and social
conflict.  Long-term growth and political stability are mutually
interdependent.  This is recognized by the United Nations system in its
inter-agency programmes, and in the work of UNDP.

183.    UNDP cooperation with the African Development Bank covers a wide
range of development issues, the Bank acting as executing agency for
regional projects in such areas as support for women entrepreneurs,
energy, and a feasibility study for the establishment of an African
export-import bank.  During the fourth programming cycle, UNDP-financed
projects executed by the Bank amounted to $6 million.

184.    UNDP cooperation with the Asian Development Bank covers almost
all sectors, with particular focus on agriculture, forestry, fisheries,
and natural resources.  UNDP-financed projects executed by the Bank
during the fourth programming cycle amounted to $21 million.  The
relationship is changing as a result of the growing trend towards
national execution in the region, and as a result of the greater
concentration of UNDP resources on fewer areas of activity.

185.    For Latin America and the Caribbean, UNDP and the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) have an agreement for cooperation and
coordination that has led to successful co-financing and joint
programming at the national level.  Since it is clear that a modern
economy without a modern society will not be viable, one aim of such
joint projects on human development and governance is to forestall
conflict by supporting consensus-building and enhancing the
responsiveness of government to civil society.  A joint methodology for
human development and social reform has been developed, based on
consensus-building and the formulation of responsible long-term public
policy.  A new strategy for IDB lending to the social sector was debated
at a major conference co-sponsored by UNDP and IDB, and was subsequently
approved by the Bank's Governing Board.

186.    In the field of environment, IDB and UNDP helped the countries
of Latin America and the Caribbean prepare a common agenda for the Rio
de Janeiro Conference that was widely used in the discussions and
negotiations.  Given the region's strong capacity for policy analysis
and also given small indicative planning figures, the role of UNDP has
also been to provide seed money and to support Governments in managing
loans from multilateral financial institutions.

187.    At a time when UNDP is being required to address both ongoing
and new priorities in a growing number of recipient countries, it is
disturbing to report that, after several years of annual increases,
contributions to UNDP in 1992 fell to $1,073 million and in 1993 to an
estimated $930 million (see figure 7).  While I recognize that donor
countries are under severe financial constraints, it is my hope that the
levels of funding of UNDP will be restored, given the magnitude of the
development challenge the world now faces.

        4.  United Nations Population Fund

188.    The annual increase in the world's population reached a record
level of 93 million.  Rapid rates of population growth place a strain on
economic growth and hence on development.  Yet population growth can be
greatly affected by development measures.

189.    The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) continues to promote
the concept of family planning as a basic human right, based on the
principle of informed and voluntary choice.  According to the World
Health Organization, some 910,000 conceptions occur every day.  Half are
unplanned.  A quarter are unwanted.  Some 1,370 women die every day from
causes related to pregnancy or childbirth, most of them in developing
countries.  Thousands more nearly die.  Many themselves are children.
Many such tragic situations could be avoided if family planning and
maternal health programmes were available.

190.    One encouraging development is that an increasing number of
countries are now linking population issues to national development
policies and priorities.  To support those countries, UNFPA took steps
to enhance strategic programming, promoted the provision of requisite
technical assistance, and supported national capacity-building for
national execution and for coordination of population programme
activities.

191.    In compliance with the requirements of General Assembly
resolution 47/199, UNFPA strengthened its efforts to build national
capacity to manage population programmes, with the aim of enabling
countries to become self-reliant in population policy and execution.
The core of the Fund's successor support-cost arrangements is high-level
technical assistance to help Governments assume the management of
UNFPA-funded programmes and projects.  The principal UNFPA mechanism for
providing technical support services is the country support team,
consisting of a team leader and technical advisers; those teams are
designed to support not only national execution and national
capacity-building but also the decentralization of authority, another
emphasis given by the Assembly in resolution 47/199.

192.    Low growth prospects, and indeed poor social integration
policies, in many countries have increased migration from the
underdeveloped to the developed world.  There are today some 100 million
international migrants, around 2 per cent of the world population.  Of
these, 17 million are refugees and a further 20 million have fled
deteriorating economic and ecological conditions at home.  This is
causing strains in both the receiving countries - Europe alone received
15 million migrants between 1980 and 1992 - and in the sending
countries, strains which have resulted in a renewal of political and
social tensions world wide.

193.    UNFPA continues to pay particular attention to ensuring that
gender issues are reflected in all aspects of development assistance,
especially in capacity-building.  Women and children are often the
hardest hit victims of conflict.  In situations where no conflict
exists, they are often denied their importance in social construction.
For women to realize to the full their potential role as agents of
change, they must be able to determine the frequency and timing of
childbirth and must have equal access to education and jobs.

194.    The World Conference on Population and Development will be held
at Cairo in September 1994.  The second session of the Preparatory
Committee for the Conference was successfully convened in New York in
May 1993, and a third session is scheduled to take place in New York in
April 1994.  The regional commissions are preparing the ground for a
conference which will take up the challenge of people-centred
development.

        5.  World Food Programme

195.    The World Food Programme (WFP), with total expenditure in 1992
of nearly $1.7 billion, is a major source of grant assistance for
developing countries in the United Nations system.  Of that amount, 65
per cent was for emergency relief, 29 per cent for development projects,
and 6 per cent for programme support and administrative costs.

196.    The balance between emergency and development assistance
provided by WFP has altered considerably in the last three years, as the
growing needs of victims of natural and man-made disasters have
continued to dominate its work.  Previously, emergency assistance
accounted for no more than a third of the Programme's annual
expenditure; in 1992, with active relief operations in 48 countries, WFP
handled 60 per cent of all international relief food.  Commitments for
relief activities in 1992 were nearly 50 per cent higher than in 1991
and nearly three times as high as in 1990.  For 1993, commitments for
relief activities are expected to total $1.25 billion, down slightly
from the 1992 record of $1.4 billion.

197.    It is estimated that in 1992 some 42 million poor people in
developing countries directly benefited from WFP food aid provided in
support of development activities or as relief assistance.  Of that
number, some 27.5 million people, including 14.4 million refugees and
displaced people, received WFP relief food in the course of the year.

198.    As a result of the increase in relief food aid needs in 1992,
WFP handled an all-time record of 5.2 million tons of food.  The cost of
transporting that food totalled more than $400 million.  Three fifths of
all shipments of WFP food for the year were for relief, both for
short-term emergencies and for long-term refugees and displaced people,
compared to one third in earlier years.

199.    As conflict and civil strife continue to cause suffering
throughout the world, WFP has encouraged international efforts to
develop the principle of safe passage of relief food aid in war zones.
In a number of countries, such as Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, Iraq,
Liberia, Mozambique, Somalia, the Sudan and the former Yugoslavia,
conflict has hampered efforts to deliver humanitarian relief.  WFP staff
are often exposed to personal risk in operations to deliver food to
civilians trapped by fighting.

200.    In 1992, the Committee on Food Aid Policies and Programmes
endorsed a more extensive and systematic application of WFP assistance
to support disaster prevention, preparedness, mitigation and
rehabilitation measures, particularly in Africa.  In several countries,
including the Gambia, Malawi, Mozambique and Uganda, WFP responded to
relief needs by providing food to an increasing number of beneficiaries
through ongoing development projects.  At the end of 1992, WFP was
assisting 258 such projects, with total commitments valued at $3
billion.  It is estimated that 15 million people received food through
WFP-assisted development projects.

201.    New WFP commitments for development projects in 1992 ($421
million, representing 1.1 million tons of food) were the lowest in value
terms since 1978.  This resulted from a continuing decline since 1988 in
resources made available to WFP for development assistance and the need
to bring commitments more into line with the expected future
availability of resources.  In 1993, commitments for future development
projects are expected to decline further, to $300 million, representing
850,000 tons.  Shipments to ongoing development projects in 1993 are
expected to reach $470 million, representing 1.4 million tons, which is
close to the average for the past four years.

        6.  United Nations International Drug Control Programme

202.    The United Nations International Drug Control Programme
coordinates all drug control activities within the United Nations system
and acts as a point of reference for action taken by Governments.  The
Programme also supports technical cooperation activities which reflect
its comparative advantage at the multilateral level.  Its strategic
priorities have been adapted to evolving drug-related trends, which are
themselves driven by unprecedented developments in the political,
economic and social fields.  I am encouraged by the fact that, during
the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly, four plenary meetings
will be devoted to the issue of international cooperation against
illicit drugs.

203.    The United Nations International Drug Control Programme has
indicated that the inter-agency meeting on international drug abuse
control to be held in 1994 will focus on the theme of women, drug abuse
and drug control.

       C.  Regional development activities

204.    The regional commissions carry out important
information-gathering and socio-economic analysis functions in their
respective regions.  They have been playing a major role in developing
policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic, social,
political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development.
They thus provide a forum and a network for cooperation among their
member States and between them and other States at the technical level.
In addition, they are increasingly becoming providers of technical
cooperation, especially in intersectoral areas and in areas where no
other United Nations body has a comparative advantage.

205.    In the restructuring process on which I have embarked I have
emphasized the important contribution of the regional commissions.
Steps have therefore been taken to strengthen the functions of the
commissions and to increase their responsibilities.  Those steps are
designed to enhance the contribution of the commissions - as the
regional arms of a single, integrated United Nations programme in the
social and economic field - to the global work of Headquarters
departments.

206.    Regional commissions should function as the main centres within
the United Nations system for general economic and social development in
their respective regions.  Decentralization should not however entail a
fragmentation of the activities of the Secretariat; rather, it should
promote complementarity and mutual reinforcement of activities and
should contribute to the cohesiveness of the work of the United
Nations.

        1.  Economic Commission for Africa

207.    In 1993, the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) intensified
its search for durable solutions to the continent's problems and its
efforts to put Africa on the path to sustained and sustainable
development by articulating policy measures that respond to the needs of
African countries in the social and economic fields.

208.    Among the principal activities undertaken by the ECA secretariat
was the preparation for and convening of the Third African Population
Conference, which was held at Dakar in December 1992.  The Conference
was convened in response to Economic and Social Council resolution
1991/93, in which the Council asked regional commissions to convene
conferences to review experience gained in population policies and
programmes in their regions as part of their contribution to the
preparations for the International Conference on Population and
Development, to be held at Cairo in 1994.

209.    The ECA secretariat also contributed to the report of the
Secretary-General on major issues and programme activities relating to
social development to the Commission for Social Development at its
thirty-third session, in February 1993.  A progress report on
preparatory activities for the International Year of the Family was also
prepared for the inter-agency meeting on the Year held at Vienna in
March 1993.

210.    During the seventh meeting of the Joint Intergovernmental
Regional Committee on Human Settlements and Environment, which was held
at Addis Ababa in March 1993, a report on the follow-up to the Rio de
Janeiro Conference was presented.  That report included preliminary
proposals for strategies to implement Agenda 21 within the framework of
the African Common Position on Environment and Development.  The
proposals related to the major African environmental and development
concerns as expressed in the African Common Position.  The comments of
the Committee were brought to the attention of the ECA Conference of
Ministers at its nineteenth meeting.

211.    The ECA secretariat continued its efforts to promote the
objectives of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons (1983-1992)
through the publication and circulation of the newsletter Equal Time, in
which a number of activities undertaken by and for disabled persons were
highlighted.

212.    With regard to the least developed, island and land-locked
countries, ECA produced a Survey of Economic and Social Conditions in
the African Least Developed Countries (1991-1992).  That study gives a
detailed account of the structure of GDP and the development of the
major economic sectors (agriculture, manufacturing, mining), including
an assessment of trade, balance of payments, debt and development
finance flows and policies pursued in the African least developed,
island and land-locked countries.

213.    The Executive Secretary of ECA participated in the meetings of
the panel of high-level personalities on African development.  ECA
prepared for the panel a paper on the role of indigenous African
non-governmental organizations, as part of a report on the role of
non-governmental organizations in Africa's development prepared by the
Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development.

214.    The twenty-eighth session of the Economic Commission for Africa
and nineteenth meeting of the Conference of Ministers responsible for
economic development and planning, which was held in May 1993, devoted
much attention to the challenges of Africa's development in the 1990s
and beyond.  It had before it the Commission's Economic Report on
Africa, 1993 and a number of technical studies prepared for its
consideration.

215.    The Conference endorsed several strategic objectives as the key
to Africa's development in the 1990s.  It considered a study on
financial resource mobilization for Africa's development, in which it
was estimated that about $950 billion (in constant 1990 dollars) of
external resources would be required to attain, between 1993 and 2005,
the growth target set by the General Assembly in the United Nations New
Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s.  In view of the
gravity of Africa's external debt burden, well over 50 per cent of that
amount would be consumed in servicing inherited external debt, unless
steps bolder than conventional debt reduction initiatives are
implemented.

216.    Other development issues addressed by the Conference included
human development and the advancement of women in Africa, and
preparations for the International Conference on Population and
Development, the Fourth World Conference on Women, and the World Summit
for Social Development.  The Conference also addressed topics related to
the implementation of Agenda 21, as well as trade and investment issues
in Africa.

        2.  Economic Commission for Europe

217.    The break-up of the Soviet Union and of Yugoslavia and the
separation of the Czech and Slovak Republics led to the emergence of new
States, and as a result the membership of the Economic Commission for
Europe (ECE) has increased from 34 to 53, and includes former Soviet
republics in Transcaucasia and Central Asia.

218.    Not only the increase in the number of members poses new
challenges to ECE:  the very nature of the Commission has changed.
Almost half the member States are now countries in transition, some of
them clearly at the stage of developing countries.  In its analytical
work, the ECE secretariat now has to deal with 25 countries in
transition which have replaced 8 centrally planned economies.

219.    In accordance with the mandate drawn up by the Commission in
1990, ECE has launched a major programme of technical assistance to
countries in transition.  That programme could be considerably expanded
in areas such as advisory services and training, provided the
decentralization process now under way strengthens the resource base of
ECE.  Furthermore, given the number of United Nations programmes and
bodies which provide technical assistance in the ECE region, a more
coordinated approach is needed to ensure that the aid provided by the
United Nations is coherent, well-targeted and demand-driven.  The
interim office concept, described in section II.B above, was developed
in response to that need.

220.    Specific requests for assistance have been formulated by
individual ECE countries.  In response to General Assembly resolutions,
the Commission invited all its subsidiary bodies to identify ways and
means of contributing to international efforts to assist in the
mitigation of the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and in
the reconstruction of Croatia.  ECE involvement in the latter endeavour
is in accordance with the original mandate of the Commission to assist
in the reconstruction of war-devastated zones.  A coherent United
Nations strategy which ensures an integrated approach to the
reconstruction and rehabilitation of war-ravaged areas in the ECE region
should be prepared by competent United Nations programmes without
delay.

221.    The Commission, at its forty-eighth session, in April 1993,
defined environment, transport, statistics, trade facilitation and
economic analysis as its priority areas of activity.  Those priorities
were reflected in decisions adopted at that session on questions of
environment and sustainable development, cooperation and sustainable
development in the chemical industry and cooperation in the field of
transport.  The Commission also adopted a decision on activities
designed to assist countries of the region in transition to a market
economy and their integration with the European and global economy.  The
Commission called for further economic cooperation in the Mediterranean
region in the light of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe, held at Helsinki in 1975.

222.    The Economic Survey of Europe in 1992-1993, published by ECE,
contains an in-depth analysis of the European transition countries;
their output and demand; labour markets, prices and incomes; foreign
trade and payments; macroeconomic policies; market reforms; and progress
made in privatization.  The Survey also includes a review of
developments in central, eastern and south-eastern European countries,
the countries of the former Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union, and
the Baltic republics, together with a discussion of Western responses to
the transition in central and eastern Europe in aid and trade, analysing
the financial flows and commitments of assistance, and East-West
cooperation agreements and market access.

223.    ECE continued to make useful contributions to global programmes
of the United Nations.  The Commission submitted to the Rio de Janeiro
Conference a compendium of its conventions in the field of environmental
protection.  As a part of the preparations for the International
Conference on Population and Development, ECE held a European Population
Conference jointly with UNFPA and the Council of Europe in March 1993.
At its forty-eighth session, the Commission decided to convene a
high-level regional preparatory meeting for the Fourth World Conference
on Women.  It also endorsed work under way in socio-economic activities
as a contribution to the World Summit for Social Development.  Each
year, more than 30 countries from outside the ECE region participate
actively in the work of the Commission, and the results of its work are
made available to the developing countries of other regions.

224.    The intensive efforts of the ECE secretariat have resulted in
further progress in strengthening cooperation and coordination with
organizations and institutions such as the Commission of the European
Communities, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development,
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Council of
Europe.

        3.  Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean

225.    The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean
(ECLAC), which includes the Latin American and Caribbean Institute for
Economic and Social Planning (ILPES) and the Latin American Demographic
Centre (CELADE), focused on the promotion of sustainable growth with
equity.  Two major publications were produced and presented to the
Commission at its twenty-fourth session, in April 1992, and were
subsequently given wide distribution.  The first publication, entitled
Social Equity and Changing Production Patterns:  An Integrated Approach,
explores how the region's countries can advance simultaneously in
sustainable growth with greater equity.  It has been hailed by policy
makers as an important conceptual contribution to development economics.
The second publication was prepared jointly with UNESCO, under the title
Education and Knowledge:  Basic Pillars of Changing Production Patterns
with Social Equity; it highlights the crucial importance of those topics
for increasing levels of productivity and improved equity.

226.    CELADE also helped to disseminate demographic knowledge among
the Governments of the region by organizing the Meeting of Government
Experts on Population and Development in Latin America and the
Caribbean, which was held in Saint Lucia in October 1992.

227.    The fourteenth and fifteenth meetings of the Presiding Officers
of the Regional Conference on the Integration of Women into the Economic
and Social Development of Latin America and the Caribbean were held in
Curaçao in June 1992, and at Mexico City in October 1992.

228.    With regard to the integration of women into the economic and
social development of Latin America and the Caribbean, ECLAC undertook
preparatory activities for the Fourth World Conference on Women.  ECLAC
has already begun activities related to the preparation of the new
regional programme of action for women in Latin America and the
Caribbean, 1995-2001, and is preparing a diagnosis of the status of
women that substantively incorporates this question into the new ECLAC
proposal on changing production patterns with social equity.

229.    The Social Development Division concentrated its efforts on
preparing technical documents for the Third Regional Conference on
Poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean, held at Santiago in November
1992.

230.    The Commission continues its permanent role in monitoring
economic events in the region.  The formal expression of its work is
found in the Preliminary Overview of the Economy of Latin America and
the Caribbean, published with up-to-date indicators in December of each
year, and in the Economic Survey of Latin America and the Caribbean and
the Statistical Yearbook for Latin America and the Caribbean.  ECLAC
also continues to be the main forum for economic and social affairs in
the region, and the Latin American Centre for Economic and Social
Documentation is strengthening information management in the region.

231.    The Commission has undertaken numerous technical cooperation
activities, at the request of member States, to assist Governments in
the formulation and implementation of policies and plans for economic
and social development within the overall strategy of changing
production patterns with social equity.

232.    ECLAC co-sponsored the Regional Preparatory Meeting for Latin
America and the Caribbean (San José, January 1993) for the World
Conference on Human Rights and provided technical support to several
presidential forums, including the Meeting of Heads of State of Central
America and Panama (Panama, December 1992), the Heads of State of the
Rio Group (Buenos Aires, December 1992) and the third Ibero-American
Summit of Heads of State and Government (San Salvador de Bahia, Brazil,
July 1993).

        4.  Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific

233.    On 9 April 1993, I was present when His Majesty King Bhumibol
Adulyadej officially opened the new United Nations Conference Centre at
Bangkok, where the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific (ESCAP) has its offices.

234.    Regional economic cooperation is gaining ever greater momentum
in the ESCAP region.  At the same time, subregional organizations are
being revitalized and are focusing, in particular, on the development of
infrastructure within their respective subregions.  The newer forms of
economic cooperation are transcending the deeply embedded constraints of
the cold war; the States involved in the Viet Nam war, for example, are
now entering into the mainstream of development efforts in the region.

235.    Under the revised intergovernmental structure, the first session
of the Committee for Regional Economic Cooperation was convened at
Bangkok in October 1992, while the first session of its Steering Group
was held at New Delhi in November 1992.  The Steering Group considered
and adopted an action programme for regional economic cooperation in
trade and investment, which was submitted, through the Committee, to the
Commission at its forty-ninth session.

236.    The Fourth Asian and Pacific Population Conference was held in
Bali in August 1992.  The Conference, sponsored by ESCAP and UNFPA,
considered and adopted the Bali Declaration on Population and
Sustainable Development, which will serve as the basis for policy-making
and programming.

237.    The period since August 1992 has been one of transition for
ESCAP from a sectoral to a thematic approach, in terms of both the
Commission's subsidiary intergovernmental structure and its programmes.
Considerable attention has been paid to evolving thematic subprogrammes
on regional economic cooperation, poverty alleviation through economic
growth and social development, and environment and sustainable
development in response to this shift in approach.  During the same
period, ESCAP activities have focused increasingly on the social
dimensions of development.  At the forty-ninth session of the
Commission, in April 1993, 3 of the 10 resolutions adopted related to
areas of social concern.

238.    In December 1992, ESCAP convened the Meeting to Launch the Asian
and Pacific Decade of Disabled Persons, 1993-2002, at Beijing.  At that
Meeting, the Proclamation on the Full Participation and Equality of
People with Disabilities in the Asian and Pacific Region and the Agenda
for Action for the Asian and Pacific Decade of Disabled Persons,
1993-2002, were considered and adopted.

239.    The Special Body on Pacific Island Developing Countries held its
first session at Bangkok in February 1993.  The Special Body emphasized,
inter alia, the importance of international trade and investment for the
island economies and recommended the strengthening of finance,
investment and trade links between them and the more dynamic economies
of the ESCAP region.  The secretariat has issued various
research-oriented publications pertinent to the development of the
Pacific island developing countries, including Sustainable Agricultural
Development Strategies in the Pacific Island Least Developed Countries:
Issues and Policy Options and The Law of the Sea in the South Pacific:
A Study on the Integration of Marine Affairs Activities within
Government Concerns.

240.    A study of the theme topic "Expansion of investment and
intraregional trade as a vehicle for enhancing regional economic
cooperation and development in Asia and the Pacific", presented in part
two of the Economic and Social Survey for Asia and the Pacific, 1992,
assessed the contribution of the trade-investment nexus to the process
of industrial restructuring in the ESCAP region.

241.    Measures have been taken to reinforce the functional
relationship between ESCAP and various United Nations organizations and
bodies with a view to undertaking a coordinated approach to
problem-solving and rendering assistance to the member States.  In
addition to meetings held in recent months by the various inter-agency
mechanisms, including the Inter-agency Committee on Environment and
Development in Asia and the Pacific, the Inter-agency Committee on
Integrated Rural Development and the Inter-agency Task-Force on Water
for Asia and the Pacific, ESCAP has been seeking to develop greater
linkages and cooperative frameworks with other regional bodies.  In that
context, special focus has been placed on strengthening the relationship
between ESCAP and organizations such as the Association of South-East
Asian Nations, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, the
South Pacific Forum secretariat, the Economic Cooperation Organization
and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, as well as with financial
institutions such as the Asian Development Bank.

        5.  Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia

242.    In the post-cold-war era, as the world moves towards global
economic management, and as conflict and cooperation battle for
dominance, the challenges to the region of the Economic and Social
Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) increase in intensity and scope.
The ESCWA region may also be considered a region in transition.  It is
at the cross-roads between the politics and cultures of the East and the
West, a region searching to assert the identity of its people, to
protect its internal and external sovereignty, and to withstand internal
and external pressures.  A most serious challenge to the political
stability of the region is the eruption of new forms of extremism.
Political instability, uncertainty and unpredictability continue to
plague the region and to exercise a preponderant influence on its peace,
development and security prospects.  These imminent challenges need to
be tackled swiftly and surely.

243.    The physical destruction and damage to the environment, the
problems of returnees and pressures on the labour markets and the
infrastructure, the instability in oil prices, the decline of recurrent
financial transfers in aid and remittances, continued sanctions against
Iraq and their adverse impact on neighbouring countries represent
enormous challenges to the ESCWA region.

244.    These crisis-related challenges come on top of long-standing
structural imbalances, such as the income disparities between and within
countries; the uneven distribution of energy resources at the regional
level; inadequate energy supply, water shortages, desertification, and
lack of food security and transport linkages in many rural and remote
areas; vulnerability to fluctuations in oil prices; and external
indebtedness.

245.    In its desire to contribute to efforts to redress some of the
worst physical and social ravages of the Gulf crisis, as well as
man-made and natural disasters, the Commission at its sixteenth session,
in September 1992, declared the period 1994-2003 a Reconstruction and
Rehabilitation Decade for Western Asia.  To streamline regional action,
and in collaboration with the League of Arab States, ESCWA set up an
inter-agency Joint Committee for Environment and Development in the Arab
Region in April 1993.  In addition, ESCWA is in the process of
establishing a regional water council to coordinate activities for a
more efficient use of scarce water resources.  To that end, a regional
inter-agency consultative mechanism was formed for water and environment
which would serve as the nucleus for a regional administrative
coordination committee.

246.    The secretariat participated in the formulation of a plan of
action to combat desertification region-wide.  The Second Amman
Declaration on Population and Development of April 1993 is an instrument
to promote regional cooperation and to assist member States in dealing
with population issues and population movements.  In the area of
transport, ESCWA is heavily involved in activities related to the
Transport and Communications Decade in Western Asia (1985-1994).  To
help bridge the widening technological gap, ESCWA focused on the
formulation of policies and measures to increase the effectiveness of
the technology factor in the investment process.  To overcome the lack
of timely, reliable and replicable statistics and data, ESCWA set up the
Committee on Statistics as a subsidiary body of the Commission.

247.    In addition to preparing studies and convening intergovernmental
and expert group meetings, ESCWA provided technical assistance and
advisory services to member States to assist them in meeting challenges
and formulating action-oriented policies.  For example, the Commission
convened an expert group meeting on the operation of enterprises under
severe and fast-changing conditions.  Other meetings were convened on
the creation of indigenous entrepreneurship, especially to train
returnees, and on unemployment as one of the major challenges facing
society.  Training activities were introduced as pilot projects to allow
women to cope with their multiple roles and contribute to production.
ESCWA also assisted in meeting the needs for rural energy through the
introduction of biogas technology in selected countries of the region.

248.    Under the auspices of ESCWA, a multi-disciplinary task force on
the Palestinian people and the occupied Arab territories was set up to
deal with socio-economic issues emanating from the Israeli occupation
and the implications of a peace settlement for countries of the region.
The task force will also provide technical assistance to the Palestinian
people.

249.    The most important obstacles facing the Commission in fulfilling
its mandate remain the uncertainty and political instability in the
region, which have caused interruption in its activities and its
relocation several times in the recent past.  They have also contributed
to the rifts among countries of the region and the set-backs in
cooperation to which failures in the region's performance and inadequate
rapport between member States and the secretariat are attributed.  These
in turn have caused a dwindling of extrabudgetary funding and a paucity
of resources to address emerging needs and, consequently, inadequate
regional coordination and harmonization in implementing projects of a
regional scope.

       D.  Protection of human rights

        1.  Centre for Human Rights

250.    In the course of 1993, the activities of the Centre for Human
Rights at Geneva underwent a significant expansion in the five main
areas of its work: research, standard-setting and prevention of
discrimination; implementation of international standards; special
procedures; communications; and advisory services and information.

251.    On 1 January 1993, I appointed an Assistant Secretary-General to
head the Centre for Human Rights, with responsibility for dealing
exclusively with human rights issues, to report directly to me.  The
Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights is responsible in
particular for developing coherent policies and strengthening
coordination in the field of human rights, and he serves as a focal
point for United Nations relations with regional organizations on human
rights matters.

252.    The World Conference on Human Rights, in June 1993, asked for an
immediate increase in the Centre's resources from the regular budget.
The Conference indicated clearly that those resources should support the
work of the Centre in fulfilling its many urgent mandates, provide for
the implementation of the fact-finding procedures of the Commission on
Human Rights, ensure the functioning of the treaty bodies and provide
sufficient resources to the advisory services programme to enable it to
respond to requests by States for assistance.  The Conference also
called for increased contributions to the voluntary funds supporting
advisory services and activities in favour of indigenous people and
against racial discrimination.  Those matters will be addressed in my
budget proposals for the biennium 1994-1995.

        2.  World Conference on Human Rights

253.    The World Conference on Human Rights, which was held at Vienna
from 14 to 25 June 1993, was a turning-point in United Nations
activities for the promotion and protection of human rights.  The
Conference was the culmination of three years of intense activity by all
segments of the international community directed at reviewing past
progress in the protection of human rights, identifying obstacles to
further progress and charting the course of action for the coming
years.

254.    The Vienna Conference and its preparatory process were world
wide, in terms both of the subjects dealt with and of participation.
Three regional meetings, held at Tunis, San José and Bangkok, preceded
the Conference, as did hundreds of other meetings around the world.
Representatives from 172 States took part in the discussions at Vienna
together with observers from 95 international organizations, human
rights bodies and national human rights institutions and from 840
non-governmental organizations.  A high level of expertise, and a clear
commitment to human rights on the part of the participants, contributed
to the success of the debates.  Long and careful exchanges of view
revealed considerable common ground among the different participants.
The Conference was therefore able to adopt by consensus a declaration
and programme of action of historic proportions, but differences of
opinion were also candidly stated.

255.    The Vienna Conference reaffirmed the universality of fundamental
human rights and the principle that the human person is the central
subject of human rights, should be the principal beneficiary and should
participate actively in the realization of human rights.  But the
Conference did not deal with the question solely at a theoretical level:
it also called for effective action to secure the human rights of every
individual on a universal basis.  The Conference also recognized the
right to development as a human right and the mutually reinforcing
interrelationship between democracy, development and respect for human
rights, and the need to assist developing countries in their
democratization process.  It also clearly established the link between
universality and equality, and stressed the need to eliminate all
discrimination based on race and similar factors.  The Conference
provided substantive guidance for the United Nations in its future work
in this area and called for world-wide action against discrimination and
in favour of tolerance.

256.    There was also notable progress in two other areas.  The
Conference stressed that priority should be given to action to secure
the full and equal enjoyment by women of all human rights:  respect for
women's rights must be integrated into the overall human rights
programme and into development activities.  Special attention must be
given to protecting women and girl children from violence and other
human rights violations which threaten them particularly.  The
Conference called for universal ratification of the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women by the year
2000, and the drafting of an optional protocol to that Convention to
permit individual complaints of violations of women's rights to be
considered.

257.    The need to act effectively to protect the rights of children,
including children in especially difficult circumstances and the girl
child, was another step forward.  All competent organs are being asked
to review and monitor progress in protecting children's rights and the
year 1995 has been set as the target for the universal ratification of
the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

258.    Another important step forward was the recognition of the rights
of persons with disabilities and of the need to take specific measures
to protect vulnerable groups, including migrant workers, and to ensure
that they participate in the search for solutions to their own problems.
The human rights dimensions of extreme poverty and exclusion were also
recognized, as was the need to deal not only with human rights
violations but also with their causes.  In this context the Conference
called for national and international action on a priority basis to
eliminate specific obstacles to the enjoyment of human rights.

259.    During this International Year for the World's Indigenous
People, the Vienna Conference recognized the inherent dignity and unique
contribution of indigenous people, reaffirmed the international
community's commitment to their well-being, and reiterated the
obligation of States to ensure respect for their rights.

260.    A key result of the Conference was the widespread acceptance of
the need for cooperation between Governments, the United Nations, other
international organizations, national human rights institutions and
non-governmental organizations.  An effective partnership involving all
those actors is essential for the effective promotion and protection of
human rights.

261.    The Vienna Conference recognized the increasingly important
contribution non-governmental organizations can play in human rights
activities, especially in relation to development and human rights.  One
of the most important achievements of the Conference was its success in
harnessing the energies of hitherto untapped grass-roots organizations,
particularly from Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean.

262.    The importance of human rights to United Nations activities in
the fields of peacemaking, peace-keeping and preventive diplomacy, and
in social and economic development, was also amply demonstrated by the
Vienna Conference.  The inclusion of the human rights dimension in the
planning, implementation and evaluation of programmes and projects in
those areas will be important to their success and to the promotion of
human rights.

263.    Increased attention is to be given to implementing economic,
social and cultural rights through, in particular, the drafting of
optional protocols to the 1966 International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights and the use of indicators.

264.    Education was repeatedly stressed as a crucial element in
building future respect for human rights.  By adopting a concrete and
practical approach it should be possible for human rights to be included
in teaching programmes in all countries, both in schools and in
programmes for those who are not in school.

265.    The Vienna Conference reaffirmed that efforts to eradicate
torture should be concentrated on prevention, and called for the early
adoption of an optional protocol to the 1984 Convention against Torture
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to allow
regular visits to places of detention.  It also recommended that States
should abrogate legislation leading to impunity for those responsible
for torture.

266.    The role of the United Nations in the promotion and protection
of human rights must be strengthened, renewed and revitalized if the
promises of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action are to be
kept.  International coordination and cooperation were seen at Vienna as
crucial for improving respect for human rights.  United Nations bodies,
specialized agencies, regional intergovernmental organizations and
national human rights institutions all have important contributions to
make in this overall coordinated approach.

267.    The Centre for Human Rights was identified as the focal point
for global cooperation for human rights.  The Conference called for an
annual United Nations coordination meeting at a high level as one
element in this approach.  Close cooperation will also have to be
established with other key actors.

268.    The Vienna Conference recognized that future progress would
depend in large part on the availability of assistance to countries
engaged in improving and strengthening their protection of human rights.
An overall United Nations approach was called for, enabling States to
strengthen democratic institutions and the rule of law, to protect
minority rights and those of indigenous peoples, and to hold democratic
elections.  The programme of advisory services and technical assistance
in the field of human rights has been given specific new and
wide-ranging responsibilities in helping to improve respect for human
rights.

269.    The United Nations must be able to respond rapidly and
professionally to allegations of human rights violations and to service
adequately the machinery set up for that purpose.  We must at the same
time seek ways of improving the operation and impact of those
mechanisms.

270.    The Vienna Conference also proposed that United Nations
activities in human rights be given greater focus by means of three
decades for action:  one relating to indigenous people, one for
education and human rights and one against racism and racial
discrimination.  The General Assembly, in addition, has before it the
Conference's proposal for a United Nations decade for human rights.

       3.  Implementation of human rights conventions

271.    The Vienna Conference set universal ratification of the basic
international human rights treaties as an important objective.  In 1998
the follow-up review of the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and
Programme of Action will give special attention to the progress made
towards universal ratification.

272.    As at 7 September 1993, the 1965 International Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination has been ratified by
137 States and the 1973 International Convention on the Suppression and
Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid by 97 States.  Of the two 1966
Human Rights Covenants, the International Covenant on Economic, Social
and Cultural Rights has been ratified by 125 States and the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by 123 States.  The
1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
against Women has been ratified by 126 States, and the 1989 Convention
on the Rights of the Child by 146 States.

273.    The level of ratification of other conventions is most
unsatisfactory, however.  So far, only 76 States have ratified the 1984
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading
Treatment or Punishment; only 56 States have ratified the 1985
International Convention against Apartheid in Sports; only 2 States have
ratified the 1990 International Convention on the Protection of the
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families; and the
Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, adopted
by the General Assembly on 15 December 1989, has been ratified by only
19 States.

274.    As Secretary-General of the United Nations, I strongly urge
States to ratify all human rights treaties.  To that end, I intend to
open a dialogue with Member States to identify and to try to overcome
the obstacles to ratification.  I also believe that regional
organizations have a positive role to play in making States more aware
of this issue.

275.    The process of democratization cannot be separated from the
protection of human rights.  More precisely, the effective safeguarding
of human rights is possible only in a democratic framework.  It is
therefore not possible to separate the United Nations promotion of human
rights from the global trend towards democratization.

                 IV.  EXPANDING PREVENTIVE DIPLOMACY, HUMANITARIAN
                      ASSISTANCE AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION

        A.  Implementing an Agenda for Peace

276.    On 18 December 1992 the General Assembly, in its resolution
47/120, welcomed my report entitled "An Agenda for Peace" and encouraged
me to pursue my efforts in preventive diplomacy.  The Assembly also
invited me to strengthen the capacity of the Secretariat for the
collection of information and analysis to serve better the early-warning
needs of the Organization.  The informal open-ended working group
established by the Assembly has continued to discuss other
recommendations contained in my report, which has also been considered
by the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the
Strengthening of the Role of the Organization and the Special Committee
on Peace-keeping Operations.

277.    The Security Council held monthly meetings between October 1992
and May 1993 to examine specific proposals made in "An Agenda for
Peace".  Eight statements by the President were issued as part of this
process.  On 15 June 1993, I submitted a report (A/47/965-S/25944) on
the implementation of the recommendations contained in "An Agenda for
Peace".  An interdepartmental task force was also set up to propose
further measures for implementing those recommendations.

278.    In "An Agenda for Peace", I set out some definitions of the
range of peace operations undertaken by the United Nations across the
world.  Preventive diplomacy is action to prevent disputes from arising
between parties, to prevent existing disputes from escalating into
conflicts and to limit the spread of the latter when they occur.
Peacemaking is action to bring hostile parties to agreement, essentially
through such peaceful means as those foreseen in Chapter VI of the
Charter of the United Nations.  Peace-keeping is the deployment of a
United Nations presence in the field, hitherto with the consent of all
the parties concerned, normally involving United Nations military or
police personnel and frequently civilians also.  Peace-keeping is a
technique that expands the possibilities for both the prevention of
conflict and the making of peace.  The concept of peace enforcement
should be added here.  It involves peace-keeping activities which do not
necessarily involve the consent of all the parties concerned.  Peace
enforcement is foreseen in Chapter VII of the Charter.  Peace-building
is action to identify and support structures which will tend to
strengthen and solidify peace so as to avert a relapse into conflict.
Preventive diplomacy seeks to resolve disputes before violence breaks
out; peacemaking and peace-keeping, and sometimes peace enforcement, are
required to halt conflicts and preserve peace once it is attained.  If
successful, they strengthen the opportunity for post-conflict
peace-building, which can prevent the recurrence of violence among
nations and peoples.  In practice, the various steps of peace operations
are intertwined and may be performed simultaneously and in parallel.

        B.  Preventive diplomacy

279.    Once an elusive and undefined concept, preventive diplomacy is
now becoming understood as a vital field for practical action.  New
forms of preventive diplomacy have evolved in the course of the past
year; it incorporates efforts designed to prevent the occurrence of
armed conflict, such as fact-finding, good offices and goodwill
missions, the dispatch of special envoys to tense areas, and efforts to
bring parties to a potential conflict to the negotiating table.  Today,
the variety of challenges faced by the United Nations has led to a more
intensive and creative use of such familiar techniques.

280.    I find myself frequently engaged in preventive diplomacy.
Because of the nature of this work, and the requirements of the parties,
such diplomacy often takes place behind the scenes.  When efforts fail,
the results will be seen in public.  When there is success, the story
must often remain untold.  Preventive diplomacy takes place continuously
and can range from a brief telephone conversation to the movement of
military units.

281.    More than 100 missions of representation, fact-finding and
goodwill offices to various countries were undertaken on my behalf.  I
have myself travelled extensively to extend good offices and represent
the Organization throughout the world.  A catalogue of all the missions
undertaken by myself and on my behalf would be too long to include here.
Suffice it to state that, between August 1992 and July 1993, I held
high-level talks in 27 countries, visiting many of them more than once.
Some examples of action taken during the past year will illustrate the
nature of this field of endeavour and its new dimensions.

        1.  South Africa:  observers

282.    For the first time, civilian United Nations observers have been
sent to a country with the consent of the Government, to assist the
authorities of that country and the conflicting parties in what is
purely a domestic matter: containing the level of violence.  The country
in question is South Africa.  This is a significant breakthrough and
could serve as a useful precedent in similar situations elsewhere.

283.    The Security Council, in its resolution 772 (1992), authorized
me to deploy United Nations observers.  I appointed Angela King as Chief
of the United Nations Observer Mission in South Africa; she took up her
post on 23 September 1992.  The observers, together with observers from
other organizations, including the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
the Commonwealth and the European Community, have worked in close
cooperation with the National Peace Committee, the National Peace
Secretariat and the Commission of Inquiry regarding the Prevention of
Public Violence and Intimidation to reduce tensions, contain
demonstrations and stop clashes from getting out of control.  There are
now 49 United Nations observers in South Africa.  After an initial
mission undertaken on my behalf by Cyrus Vance, I designated two special
envoys, Virendra Dayal and Tom Vraalsen, who visited South Africa.  On
the basis of their findings, I submitted on 22 December 1992 a second
report on the question of South Africa (S/25004), in which I noted that
distinct progress had been made in implementing the recommendations set
out in my report of 7 August 1992 (S/24389).

284.    I have been in personal contact with President F. W. de Klerk,
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Mr. Clarence Makwetu, Mr. Nelson Mandela and
other South African leaders to assist in the strengthening of the
structures set up under the National Peace Accord.  I also addressed
letters to leaders of the homelands.  The decision to hold South
Africa's first-ever free elections in accordance with the principles of
universal suffrage opens the way for the country's transition to a
democratic and non-racial society, an objective which has defined United
Nations involvement in South Africa.  The level of violence continues,
however, to be a source of serious concern.

        2.  The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia

285.    In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, for the first time
ever in United Nations history, military units have been deployed as a
measure of preventive diplomacy.  The Security Council, in resolution
795 (1992), authorized me to establish a presence of the United Nations
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, on the borders with Albania and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).  That act of preventive deployment
was taken out of concern to avert a wider Balkan war.  There are
currently just under 1,000 peace-keepers in the region in addition to a
small group of United Nations civilian police.  At the same time, the
United Nations is providing emergency relief assistance to the 900,000
persons displaced by the conflict.  A consolidated appeal for $78
million has been launched for this humanitarian programme.

286.    Under United Nations auspices, Greece and the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia are engaged in talks intended to reduce the
tensions brought about by the recognition of the independence of the
latter.  The Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International
Conference on the Former Yugoslavia have presented to the
representatives of Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
a draft treaty prepared on the basis of extensive consultations with the
two sides.  Part A of the draft treaty includes a number of special
provisions designed to promote friendly relations and to set up
confidence-building measures, while parts B to E set out provisions for
friendship and neighbourly cooperation appropriate to the interaction of
two adjoining States establishing relations for the first time.

287.    At the time of the deployment of UNPROFOR, the Government of the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was gravely concerned about an
external security threat.  The presence of UNPROFOR and the admission to
membership in the United Nations of the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia have contributed to alleviating those fears.  In this
connection, the strengthening of UNPROFOR under Security Council
resolution 842 (1993) is a welcome development.

288.    On 18 June the Security Council, in resolution 845 (1993), urged
Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to continue their
efforts, under my auspices, to arrive at a speedy settlement of
remaining issues between them.  I have appointed Cyrus Vance to exercise
good offices on my behalf.

        3.  Preventive humanitarian action

289.    Frequently, situations of humanitarian need provide indications
of impending conflict even before they develop into more serious threats
to international peace and security.  Early awareness of the root causes
of conflict can allow appropriate preventive action to be taken.  The
provision of humanitarian assistance for such preventive purposes has
made it possible to contain the impact of some emergencies.  One such
success has been the joint United Nations-Southern Africa Development
Community drought emergency in southern Africa programme, under which
comprehensive measures to mitigate the effects of the drought, minimize
the potential population displacement and avert famine were put into
place in 10 countries of the region.

290.    Another type of preventive humanitarian action is the
strengthening of the national capacity of disaster-prone countries.  I
fully support action taken to integrate disaster prevention and
preparedness activities into the mainstream development projects of
organizations of the United Nations system within the framework of the
International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction.  For other
emergencies which result from long-term economic deterioration, or
slow-moving natural disasters such as drought, early humanitarian
preventive action can save thousands of lives and millions of dollars in
subsequent remedial action.

291.    An inter-agency early-warning mechanism for examining possible
situations of mass population displacement is being managed by the
Department of Humanitarian Affairs.  One of its purposes is to assist in
determining when preventive humanitarian action may be appropriate.

        C.  Peace-keeping in a changing context

292.    Just as preventive diplomacy and conflict resolution, familiar
responsibilities of the United Nations, have taken on new dimensions, so
the term peace-keeping now stretches across a heretofore unimagined
range of United Nations activities and responsibilities.

293.    Peace-keeping is a United Nations invention.  The concept is,
however, not a static one, but is ever changing; in order to succeed,
and to reflect the changing needs of the community of States,
peace-keeping has to be reinvented every day.  Each case in which United
Nations peace-keepers are involved draws upon the fund of experience,
imagination and professionalism of the Organization.  It is not an
exaggeration to state that today there are as many types of
peace-keeping operations as there are types of conflict.

294.    The task of peace-keeping, like that of peacemaking, is subject
to an essential constraint:  for peace-keeping to succeed, the parties
to a conflict must have the necessary political will.  Peace-keeping,
even more than peacemaking, requires the adherence of the conflicting
parties to the principle of peaceful resolution of conflicts, in other
words, to the Charter itself.

295.    Traditional assumptions relating to the upholding of agreements,
the consent and cooperation of the parties and the minimum use of force
have all been under challenge from recent developments in certain
peace-keeping operations.  United Nations peace-keepers have been sent
to areas where there are no agreements, where Governments do not exist
or have limited effective authority and where the consent and
cooperation of the parties cannot be relied upon.  All too frequently,
their work is obstructed by well-armed irregular groups and warlords who
defy both their national authorities, where these exist, and the
international community.

296.    Some 80,000 civilian and military personnel now serve in 17
United Nations peace-keeping operations across the world (see figures 8
and 9).  If additional operations and troop reinforcements at present
under consideration are implemented, the total could rise to 100,000 by
the end of 1993.  Today, peace-keepers perform a variety of complex
tasks, such as protecting humanitarian aid convoys, supporting the
supervision of elections and monitoring human rights, in addition to
their basic responsibility of keeping apart the warring parties.
Keeping the peace, therefore, is only a step in the process of the
peaceful resolution of conflicts.  It should not be confused with
conflict resolution.  Putting a halt to armed hostilities is not in
itself a solution of the conflicts.  It offers temporary respite from
hostilities, while the crisis is being resolved in the political,
humanitarian, economic and social spheres.

297.    One key aspect of the new generation of United Nations
peace-keeping operations is the role of public information in promoting
understanding and generating support at both the national and the
international levels.  That support can be built only on a clear
understanding of why a particular mission has been sent to a specific
area, and how the mission plans to accomplish its objectives.  In the
atmosphere of heightened tension in conflict areas, public information
activities play a vital role in facilitating the mission's work by
disseminating timely and objective information, and counteracting
propaganda and misinformation.  Effective public information activities
can also be instrumental in generating and sustaining the support of the
international community for the success of the missions.  In the absence
of information from the United Nations there may be misunderstandings of
the United Nations mandate, which can give rise to unwarranted criticism
of the Organization's activities.

298.    In June 1992, I was able to report that Member States were keen
to participate in peace-keeping operations and that military observers
and infantry were invariably available.  This is no longer generally the
case.  Difficulties which were previously encountered only when
specialized logistic units were sought now arise also in the case of
infantry and military as well as police observers.

299.    To deal with the increased demand for peace-keeping operations
and the consequent shortage of peace-keepers, several steps have been
taken:

        (a)     I have invited Member States to designate qualified
        personnel for consideration for secondment to a peace-keeping
        operation;

        (b)     A special planning team has been set up with the task of
        defining standard components from which different types of
        peace-keeping operations might be put together.  The team has
        briefed delegations on its work and Member States have been
        invited to enter into discussions with the Secretariat about the
        components of peace-keeping operations which they would, in
        principle, be ready to provide;

        (c)     I have accepted offers by Member States to make
        available peace-keeping personnel on loan;

        (d)     It has become necessary to use the services of
        contractors for support activities for field operations normally
        performed by United Nations staff.

300.    The respective roles of the Department of Political Affairs and
the Department of Peace-keeping Operations have, as indicated in section
II above, been more clearly defined.  The latter Department now
incorporates the Field Operations Division and is being strengthened.
It will be responsible for providing Headquarters technical and
administrative support for integrated operations in the field including,
as appropriate, peace-keeping, peacemaking, electoral or humanitarian
components.  This restructuring will enhance the planning, coordination
and reporting of peace-keeping operations and ensure better delivery of
services to the various United Nations operations.

301.    A military planning cell has been formed within the Department
of Peace-keeping Operations, with military staff on loan from Member
States.  A situation room, staffed by military officers, has been
created to enable the competent Departments to maintain a continuous
link with operations in Somalia and the former Yugoslavia.  I am
considering an integrated situation room which would cover United
Nations peace-keeping world wide in all its aspects.

302.    The growth in peace-keeping has profoundly affected the
operations of the Organization (see figure 10).  Every administrative
entity in the Secretariat has been required to assign staff to one or
more of the peace-keeping operations.  As I reported in section II
above, the staff members remaining have had to perform the tasks
previously carried out by their absent colleagues.  Demands have grown
so much that it is now no longer possible to fill all the positions
within the Secretariat or in the field with existing Secretariat staff,
and substantial additional staff will be required, since staff on loan
from Member States cannot be used to establish permanent structures.

303.    I am conscious of the mounting cost of peace-keeping and the
burden this entails for Member States.  I welcome, therefore, General
Assembly resolution 47/217, by which the Assembly authorized a
Peace-keeping Reserve Fund of $150 million, which, when fully funded,
will enhance the Organization's ability to respond to new crises.  I
hope that the General Assembly will consider favourably, at its
forty-eighth session, my proposal that it appropriate one third of the
estimated cost of each new peace-keeping operation as soon as it is
established by the Security Council.  I have also asked the Assembly to
encourage the inclusion of peace-keeping contributions in national
defence budgets.  I should like to restate here that, in accordance with
the Charter and the relevant General Assembly resolutions, financing of
peace-keeping is the collective responsibility of all Member States.

304.    One of the consequences of the delay in the payment of assessed
contributions is that States contributing to peace operations are
themselves reimbursed only after long delays.  As a result, certain
Member States have had to withdraw their contingents from peace-keeping
operations.

305.    I have proposed the setting-up of a reserve, revolving stock of
equipment to be drawn on for ongoing operations.  The subsequent
replenishment would be charged to the accounts of specific operations.

306.    The rapid rise in demand for peace-keeping operations, together
with the expansion in their scope and nature, has highlighted the urgent
need to develop and maintain uniform high standards for peace-keeping.
Training manuals are now being prepared for troops, military observers
and civilian police.  The object is to create an international pool of
peace-keeping personnel with comparable skills, knowledge, discipline
and code of conduct, able to work together effectively at short notice.

307.    An issue to which I attach the greatest importance is the safety
and security of peace-keeping personnel.  As the United Nations takes on
more complex and riskier mandates, the safety and security of United
Nations troops and other personnel have become increasingly important.
Since United Nations peace-keeping operations began, 949 peace-keepers
have lost their lives.  More than 550 have died in ongoing missions (see
figure 11).  At the request of the Security Council I have prepared a
report on existing arrangements for the protection of United Nations
forces and personnel and the adequacy of those arrangements.  I take
this opportunity to reaffirm my faith in the professionalism of United
Nations peace-keeping forces and my appreciation of their courage.  They
have performed their difficult tasks admirably, often at the cost of
life and limb, in a variety of difficult and often unfamiliar
circumstances.  The sacrifice of those who have lost their lives will
not be forgotten by the international community.

        D.  New departures in peace operations

308.    The past 12 months have shown that it is not possible to draw
clear lines between the different aspects of today's peace operations.
Each of the cases which follow will highlight one or more of the aspects
of peace operations in all their diversity; in some, nearly every
technique and activity available has to be employed across the board.

        1.  Afghanistan

309.    The goal of establishing peace and stability in Afghanistan is
still far from being achieved.  The newly established Islamic State of
Afghanistan has not yet, despite considerable efforts, succeeded in
developing the political and security conditions necessary for the
urgent tasks of reconstruction and rehabilitation and the return of
refugees.  My Personal Representative, Sotirios Mousouris, as head of
the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to
Afghanistan, is facilitating humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan.  He
also, as head of the Office of the Secretary-General in Afghanistan and
Pakistan, continues to monitor political developments there.  It is my
hope that the steps taken recently towards the implementation of the two
peace accords reached over the past seven months will create the
necessary conditions for a stable political process and the peaceful
reconstruction and rehabilitation of the country.

310.    The question of relations between Afghanistan and Tajikistan is
crucial for peace and security in the region.  I discuss this question
in paragraphs 397 to 401 below.

        2.  Angola

311.    The case of Angola illustrates the way in which United Nations
peace-keepers have had to take on a multiplicity of roles.  The United
Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II) had the responsibility
of monitoring the cease-fire and demobilization arrangements in the
country.  In addition, UNAVEM II was entrusted with witnessing the
balloting in the country's first multi-party elections after years of
devastating civil war.  The electoral component of UNAVEM II was
approved by the Security Council on 24 March 1992, and its deployment
began in April 1992.  The registration and campaign processes were
monitored by 98 international staff members in 5 regional headquarters
and 18 provincial offices.  During the period that followed,
approximately 400 observers verified the process.  In April 1992, a team
of consultants provided substantive technical assistance and support to
the electoral authorities, in close coordination with the European
Community and the United States Agency for International Development.
They contributed to the organization of a massive operation, involving a
large number of planes and helicopters, for the transport of electoral
material to areas of difficult access.  Legislative elections and the
first round of the presidential elections took place on 29 and 30
September 1992.  Despite the Mission's assessment of the electoral
process as fair, the results were not recognized by the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), which resumed hostilities,
thereby precipitating a grave political and humanitarian crisis.

312.    Since the resumption of hostilities, UNAVEM II has been engaged
once more in peacemaking activities in addition to its role of
protecting access for relief assistance.  I have been vigorously
pressing the parties, in particular UNITA, to re-establish a cease-fire
and to return as soon as possible to the peace process in order to
achieve national reconciliation.  Meanwhile, it should be made clear
that the illegal occupation by UNITA of many localities is not
acceptable to the international community.

313.    The situation faced by Angola is now more tragic than ever.  The
humanitarian crisis is reaching unprecedented proportions, and has been
worsened by severe drought in the southern part of the country.
Incidences of malnutrition and malnutrition-related diseases have
increased, and medicine and medical supplies are frequently in short
supply.  It is estimated that drought, disease and civil war have
severely disrupted the lives of at least 2 million Angolans, many of
whom cannot be reached because of security constraints.

314.    In May 1993, the Department of Humanitarian Affairs issued a
consolidated inter-agency appeal for Angola, seeking $227 million in
assistance for the one-year period ending in April 1994.  At the
conference of donors held at Geneva on 3 June, initial contributions of
approximately $70 million were registered.  The humanitarian crisis in
Angola is at least as serious as that in Somalia; unfortunately the
assistance programme in Angola has received much less financial support
from the international community.

315.    The United Nations has taken a number of measures to strengthen
its humanitarian assistance capacity and better coordinate the efforts
of all concerned, including the non-governmental organizations
participating in the relief effort.  The functions and responsibilities
of my Special Representative for Angola have been expanded to cover all
emergency relief operations arising out of the present situation.  A
humanitarian coordination assistance unit, headed by a senior official
with extensive operational experience, and reporting directly to the
Special Representative, has been set up at Luanda.  Continuing
hostilities have caused the suspension of the organized voluntary
repatriation of Angolans from Zaire and Zambia.  Repeated efforts since
May 1993 to launch an emergency relief programme for conflict-affected
areas have been thwarted by security incidents and difficult
negotiations over the destinations and means of delivery of humanitarian
assistance.  As in many similar situations, the Government and UNITA
have been called upon to observe international humanitarian law to allow
for the provision of relief assistance.

316.    The Angolan political and military situation has continued to
deteriorate dangerously as fighting has intensified and as the mistrust
which has inhibited significant political accommodation has deepened.
The possible consequences, both for Angola and for regional security,
are more and more worrying.

317.    The Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the
Organization of African Unity, meeting at Cairo in June 1993, called on
UNITA to resume the peace talks with the Government as soon as possible
with a view to establishing a definitive cease-fire and ensuring the
full implementation of the Peace Accords for Angola.  I took the
opportunity of my participation in that Assembly to consult extensively
with President José Eduardo dos Santos and other African leaders on ways
and means of advancing the peace process in Angola.

318.    Alioune Blondin Beye took over as my Special Representative from
Margaret Anstee on 30 June 1993.  I am most grateful to Ms. Anstee for
her work.  She accomplished much, in the most difficult circumstances.

319.    Since his arrival in Angola my Special Representative has been
pursuing, at various levels, intensive consultations directed at
resuming the peace talks under United Nations auspices with a view to
the establishment of a cease-fire throughout the country and the full
implementation of the Peace Accords.  Those efforts have taken my
Special Representative to Gabon, Namibia, Sao Tomé and Principe, Zaire
and Zimbabwe.

320.    In conformity with paragraph 1 of Security Council resolution
834 (1993), I have reduced the size of UNAVEM II to its current strength
of 43 international civilian staff members, 50 military observers, 18
police observers and 11 military paramedical personnel, as well as
necessary local staff.  The activities of the military and police
components of the Mission, which are currently deployed in four
locations in addition to Luanda, consist essentially of patrolling,
assessing the military situation, liaising with military and civilian
officials, assisting in the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the
civilian population and participating in other humanitarian operations.
Current staff and logistic resources are based on my assessment of the
situation at the time Security Council resolution 834 (1993) was
adopted.  However, additional administrative support will be required at
short notice if there is an increase in operations.

        3.  Armenia and Azerbaijan

321.    In October 1992 I sent a fact-finding mission to Armenia and
Azerbaijan to report on the situation there regarding the conflicts over
Nagorny Karabakh, an enclave within Azerbaijan.  In March 1993, the
conflict escalated further when the Kelbadzhar district of Azerbaijan,
between Armenia and Nagorny Karabakh, was occupied.  That development
resulted in a sudden increase in the number of displaced persons in
Azerbaijan.

322.    After the occupation of the Kelbadzhar district, the President
of the Security Council made a statement on behalf of the Council, by
which, inter alia, I was requested, in consultation with the Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), to submit urgently a
report to the Council regarding the situation on the ground.  Following
the submission of my report (S/25600), the Security Council, on 30 April
1993, adopted resolution 822 (1993), its first resolution on Nagorny
Karabakh.  Later in the year, following further fighting and occupation
of Azerbaijani territory, the Council in its resolution 853 (1993)
demanded the immediate cessation of all hostilities and the withdrawal
of the occupying forces from Agdam and all other recently occupied areas
of the Azerbaijani Republic.

323.    In the conflict relating to Nagorny Karabakh, the role of the
United Nations is essentially one of support for the efforts of CSCE.  A
United Nations observer has participated regularly in the discussions of
the Minsk Group of CSCE, which has drawn up a timetable setting out
urgent steps to be taken for achieving the withdrawal of occupying
forces from Kelbadzhar and a solution in Nagorny Karabakh, with
appropriate verification and monitoring.  I remain committed to
supporting the efforts of CSCE.

324.    In December 1992, the Department of Humanitarian Affairs, after
consulting United Nations humanitarian agencies, launched a joint appeal
for humanitarian assistance to both Armenia and Azerbaijan in the amount
of $12 million.  Following further requests for assistance from the
Governments of the two countries, inter-agency needs assessments were
organized and humanitarian needs amounting to $22.5 million for Armenia
and $12.5 million for Azerbaijan were reported.  Those assessments were
discussed at meetings of donors held at Geneva on 10 and 11 June 1993.
The humanitarian programmes are being implemented by UNICEF, WFP, the
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and
the World Health Organization (WHO), and cover the period from 1 July
1993 to 31 March 1994.  UNHCR is providing assistance to some 50,000
persons displaced by the recent fighting.  A further inter-agency needs
assessment is being planned by the Department of Humanitarian Affairs to
re-evaluate the humanitarian situation in Azerbaijan.

        4.  Cyprus

325.    In March 1993, my Special Representative, Oscar Camilión, was
recalled to the service of his Government after five years in the post.
I wish to thank Mr. Camilión for all he has done to help bring lasting
peace to Cyprus, notably his contribution to the Set of Ideas which
remains the basis of my efforts to achieve a comprehensive political
settlement of the conflict there.  I appointed Joe Clark to succeed Mr.
Camilión.

326.    Peace-keeping efforts in Cyprus have long been hampered by the
inadequacy of financial resources.  On 27 May 1993, the Security
Council, in its resolution 831 (1993), decided that with effect from the
next extension of the mandate of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force
in Cyprus (UNFICYP) on or before 15 June 1993, those costs of the Force
which are not covered by voluntary contributions should be treated as
expenses of the Organization under Article 17, paragraph 2, of the
Charter of the United Nations.

327.    By its resolution 831 (1993) the Security Council also endorsed
the restructuring plan proposed in paragraphs 16 to 19 of my report of
30 March 1993 (S/25492), with the addition of a limited number of
observers for reconnaissance and with a view to further restructuring
the Force in the light of a comprehensive reassessment of UNFICYP at the
time of the consideration of the Force's mandate in December 1993.

328.    Also, in resolution 831 (1993) the Security Council reaffirmed
that the present status quo was not acceptable and expressed concern
that the United Nations should not be entering into open-ended
peace-keeping commitments.  The restructuring of UNFICYP following
successive reductions in strength has major implications for the two
parties.  Greater responsibility rests with them for ensuring that there
is no increase in tension in Cyprus and that conditions can be
maintained for a speedy overall agreement as envisaged by the Security
Council.  It is imperative that the two sides exercise maximum restraint
and, in accordance with the package of confidence-building measures,
extend without delay the 1989 unmanning agreement to all parts of the
buffer zone where their forces remain in close proximity to each other.
I urge both sides to take reciprocal measures to lower the tension,
including mutual commitments, through UNFICYP, not to deploy along the
cease-fire lines live ammunition or weapons (other than those which are
hand held), and to prohibit firing of weapons within sight or hearing of
the buffer zone.  It is also necessary for both sides to work together
so that their own agencies can resume the humanitarian functions which,
in its efforts to restore normal conditions, UNFICYP has assumed over
the years.

329.    In the aftermath of the 1974 hostilities in Cyprus,
peace-building has been an integral part of United Nations efforts.  The
confidence-building measures I recommended to the Security Council in
November 1992 include the rehabilitation of the fenced area of Varosha
as a special area for bicommunal contact and commerce, a kind of
free-trade zone in which both sides could trade goods and services.  In
addition, Nicosia International Airport would be opened for civilian
passenger and cargo traffic under the administration of the United
Nations in cooperation with the International Civil Aviation
Organization.  Both communities would have unrestricted use of the
airport.  Supported by my Special Representative, I am continuing my
efforts to persuade the Turkish-Cypriot side to accept these proposals.
In particular, I have held two rounds of talks in New York to bring the
parties closer to agreement.

330.    Some proposals for further confidence-building measures were
also included in my report to the Security Council of 1 July 1993
(S/26026).  They include cooperation on the short-term and the long-term
water problem in Cyprus, cooperation on education to promote
intercommunal harmony and friendship, joint cultural and sports events,
meetings of political party leaders and of the Chambers of Commerce and
Industry of both sides, expert cooperation in areas such as health and
the environment, and cooperative arrangements on electricity.  It should
be emphasized, however, that confidence-building measures, beneficial
though they may be, should not be substituted for an overall solution,
nor can they be part of a step-by-step approach to such a solution.
Their purpose is to serve as a catalyst in the negotiations leading to a
comprehensive, overall solution to the question of Cyprus.

        5.  East Timor

331.    Good offices efforts for a comprehensive and internationally
acceptable solution to the question of East Timor are continuing.  As
indicated to the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session (see
A/47/435), the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and Portugal, at my
invitation, held informal consultations in New York on 26 September
1992.  This was followed by two rounds of substantive discussions
between the two Foreign Ministers under my auspices, the first in New
York on 17 December 1992 and the second in Rome on 21 April 1993.  A
number of possible confidence-building measures, designed to create an
atmosphere more propitious to addressing the core issues, were explored
at those meetings.  The discussions have continued in New York since
April, at the Permanent Representative level.  The next meeting between
the two Foreign Ministers and myself will be held on 17 September in New
York.  My Personal Envoy, Amos Wako, was in Indonesia and East Timor
from 3 to 9 April 1993.  In May 1993 a United Nations observer attended
the final stages of the trial at Dili, East Timor, of Xanana Gusmão, the
detained leader of the pro-independence movement, the Frente
Revolucionaria de Timor Leste Independente (FRETILIN).

        6.  Georgia

332.    In August 1992, fighting broke out in Abkhazia, Georgia.  Since
then, hostilities between Georgian and Abkhaz troops, supported by
irregular units from the northern Caucasus region, have resulted in
hundreds of casualties and thousands of refugees and displaced persons.
In September and October 1992, I dispatched two United Nations
fact-finding missions to Georgia and Abkhazia in support of and pursuant
to the Moscow agreement of 3 September.  After the second mission, with
Security Council endorsement, two United Nations personnel remained in
Georgia to provide an initial United Nations presence, with the tasks of
maintaining continuing contact with all concerned, providing United
Nations Headquarters with situation reports and acting as liaison.

333.    Early in 1993, the Department of Humanitarian Affairs organized
a United Nations inter-agency mission which visited all parts of
Georgia.  A consolidated appeal in the amount of $21 million was issued
at the end of March.  The appeal covered the needs of the affected
population in Abkhazia, in Government-controlled areas of Georgia and,
to a small extent, in South Ossetia.  The overall humanitarian needs of
Georgia will shortly be re-evaluated in view of the changing situation
and in consultation with United Nations humanitarian organizations.

334.    In view of the unabated fighting in Abkhazia at the beginning of
May 1993, I appointed a Special Envoy, Edouard Brunner, to Georgia to
revive the peace process; he undertook his first mission to the region
from 20 to 31 May 1993.  During that time, he also visited Stockholm,
for consultations with the Chairman-in-Office of CSCE, and Moscow for
discussions with the Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation.  In
pursuance of paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 849 (1993), I
dispatched a planning team to the conflict area on 19 July 1993.  The
team returned to New York on 27 July 1993.

335.    A cease-fire agreement, mediated by the Personal Representative
of the President of the Russian Federation, Boris Pastukhov, was signed
on 27 July 1993 by the Georgian and Abkhaz sides.  My Special Envoy
arrived in the region on 28 July, four hours after the cease-fire had
entered into force.  He stayed in the region until 31 July and had
discussions with both parties to the conflict, and with officials from
the Russian Federation.  He held further discussions with Mr. Pastukhov
and others in Moscow on 3 August.

336.    I subsequently reported to the Security Council that I
considered conditions to be right for the immediate deployment of United
Nations observers to carry out functions envisaged in the cease-fire
agreement.  The readiness of the two parties to meet and talk with each
other provides an opportunity that must not be missed.  I have,
accordingly, asked my Special Envoy to continue his efforts with a view
to convening, before 15 September, a first round of negotiations under
United Nations auspices, facilitated by the Russian Federation.

337.    The Security Council, in resolution 854 (1993) approved the
deployment of an advance team of up to 10 United Nations military
observers to verify compliance with the cease-fire agreement.  On 24
August 1993 the Security Council, in resolution 858 (1993) decided to
establish a United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG),
comprising up to 88 military observers.

        7.  Guatemala

338.    At the request of the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad
Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca, the United Nations has, since
1991, participated as an observer in negotiations directed at ending the
longest war in Central America.  The talks have been held in Mexico and
focused throughout 1992 on the issue of human rights, the first of 11
items of the negotiation agenda.  Both parties indicated their wish that
the United Nations should verify the implementation of a future
agreement on human rights.  I made it clear that the United Nations
stood ready to assist them in that area.

339.    In early 1993, with a view to facilitating final agreement on
the human rights issue and speeding up the negotiation process, the
parties agreed to consider, simultaneously with the human rights issue,
a calendar for the discussion of all outstanding agenda items and the
possibility of an early cease-fire verified by the United Nations.
Colombia, Mexico, Spain and Venezuela constituted a "Group of Friends"
to promote agreement between the parties.  That objective has so far
proved to be elusive, however.

340.    In recent months, on several occasions, the parties have
expressed the wish that the format of the talks agreed in 1991 be
altered, inter alia, to allow for a more prominent role by the United
Nations in negotiations.  I have stated that the United Nations is ready
to continue its support for the negotiation process within a framework
agreeable to both parties.

        8.  Haiti

341.    Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world:  two thirds
of its population lives below the poverty line.  Since the coup d'état
of September 1991, a trade embargo and a halt to bilateral assistance
have been imposed on Haiti.

342.    The search for a solution to the problems of Haiti has involved
measures of diplomacy directed at nothing less than the restoration of
freedom, democracy, just order and the potential for progress to an
entire nation and State.

343.    On 11 December 1992, I appointed Dante Caputo as my Special
Envoy for Haiti.  His appointment was in pursuance of General Assembly
resolution 47/20 A of 24 November 1992, in which I was requested to take
the necessary measures to assist, in cooperation with the Organization
of American States (OAS), in the solution of the Haitian crisis.  On 13
January 1993, Mr. Caputo was also appointed Special Envoy of OAS.  He
promoted negotiations to reach a political solution involving the return
of the legitimate President and the restoration of the democratic
process.  The General Assembly, by its resolution 47/20 B of 20 April
1993, mandated United Nations participation, jointly with OAS in the
International Civilian Mission to Haiti.  By March 1993, the Mission had
already been deployed throughout Haiti and, on 3 June, I submitted the
first report of the Mission to the General Assembly (A/47/960 and
Corr.1).

344.    On 16 June, by its resolution 841 (1993), the Security Council
imposed sanctions on Haiti.  Following talks held on Governors Island,
New York, agreement was reached on 3 July 1993 on various measures
relating to the return of the democratically elected President.

345.    On 12 July and 13 August 1993 I reported to the Security Council
on the Governors Island Agreement and the subsequent New York Pact,
which provides for a six-month political truce and the resumption of the
normal functioning of Parliament.  In my report of 12 July, I
recommended to the Council that the sanctions it had imposed by
resolution 841 (1993) should be suspended as soon as the Prime Minister
of Haiti had taken office.  In my report of 13 August, I referred to the
letter addressed to me by the President of the Security Council on 15
July 1993, confirming the readiness of the members of the Council to
suspend the measures imposed by resolution 841 (1993) immediately after
the ratification of the Prime Minister and his assumption of his
functions in Haiti.

346.    The Prime Minister-designate of Haiti, Robert Malval, was
ratified by the Senate on 18 August 1993 and by the Chamber of Deputies
on 23 August.  He subsequently won a vote of confidence on his programme
in the Senate on 24 August and in the Chamber of Deputies on 25 August.
The process of confirmation of the Prime Minister-designate had thus
been completed.  On 27 August 1993, by its resolution 861 (1993), the
Security Council decided that the sanctions were suspended.  The Council
also stated that the suspension would be immediately terminated if I
were to inform it that the Governors Island Agreement had not been
implemented in good faith.  Furthermore, the Council stood ready to lift
the sanctions definitively once it was informed that the relevant
provisions of the Agreement had been fully implemented.

347.    After being sworn in on 30 August, the Prime Minister travelled
to Haiti the following day to assume his functions.  Immediately after
the return of President Aristide to Haiti on 30 October 1993, I shall
report to the Security Council with a view to the sanctions being lifted
definitively.

348.    The Governors Island Agreement includes provision for United
Nations assistance for modernizing the armed forces of Haiti and
establishing a new police force with the presence of United Nations
personnel in these fields.  In a report to the Security Council on 25
August 1993 (S/26352) I outlined my plans in this regard.  On 31 August,
the Council, by its resolution 862 (1993), approved the dispatch of an
advance team to prepare for the possible deployment of the proposed
United Nations Mission to Haiti.

349.    The "silent emergency" in Haiti has been a challenge for the
humanitarian organizations of the United Nations system.  The
Organization of American States and the United Nations have made
constant efforts to respond to the considerable humanitarian needs of
the people.  Central to this process has been the formulation of a joint
United Nations/OAS comprehensive humanitarian plan of action in Haiti.
The plan contains emergency programmes in the fields of health,
nutrition and food aid, water supply and sanitation, and agriculture, as
well as support services for those areas and education and other social
services.  The needs identified totalled $62.7 million.

350.    Haiti should now be set on the path to a stable democratic
future in which all Haitians will fully enjoy human, civil and political
rights.  I trust that the international community will be generous and
forthcoming in providing Haiti with the technical and financial
assistance needed for the reconstruction of its economy and its
institutions, as well as moral and political support to the Haitian
people in their search for a just, peaceful and prosperous society.

351.    I wish here to place on record my gratitude for the support and
assistance which I and the Special Envoy have received at all times
since the beginning of the negotiating process, particularly during the
negotiations at Governors Island, from the Governments of Canada,
France, the United States of America and Venezuela, which formed a group
of "Friends of the Secretary-General" for Haiti.  Their invaluable
support has been crucial to the successful completion of this stage of
the process.

        9.  India and Pakistan

352.    The United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan
(UNMOGIP) has been monitoring the cease-fire in Jammu and Kashmir since
1949.  In the Simla Agreement of 1972, the two countries affirmed their
commitment to respecting the cease-fire line and to resolving the issue
peacefully through negotiations.  I have repeatedly urged both sides, in
the context of preventive diplomacy, to find a peaceful solution to this
difficult and complex problem.  I have also expressed my readiness,
should the two countries request it, to exert every possible effort to
facilitate the search for a lasting solution.

        10.  Iraq and Kuwait

353.    Another action was performed for the first time in history when
the United Nations demarcated the boundary between two Member States, as
part of its mandate to maintain international peace and security.  The
Security Council, in resolution 687 (1991), demanded respect for the
boundary agreed by Iraq and Kuwait in 1963, called upon me to assist in
arranging demarcation of that boundary, and decided to take, as
appropriate, all necessary measures to guarantee the inviolability of
the boundary.

354.    On 2 May 1991, the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Boundary
Demarcation Commission was established, to demarcate the international
boundary under the formula agreed in 1963.  Both Iraq and Kuwait
unconditionally accepted the terms of reference of the Commission, which
was called upon to perform a technical and not a political task.  During
its 11 sessions, the Commission examined many sources, such as maps,
graphics, aerial photographs, diplomatic correspondence, notes and
archival documents.

355.    That highly professional work has produced a precise,
well-documented and verifiable demarcation of the entire boundary.  It
includes the off-shore area from the khawrs to the eastern end of the
Khawr Abd Allah.  A complete set of coordinates was produced, and
boundary markers will clearly display the course of the line.  Satellite
technology has enabled the Commission to position each marker with a
margin of error of only 1.5 cm.  This would have been unthinkable only a
few years ago.  Other countries are already looking at this precedent to
demarcate their boundaries.

356.    The United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) has
continued to operate in the demilitarized zone established by the
Security Council on both sides of the Iraq-Kuwait boundary; that zone
has been realigned to conform to the border as demarcated.  The area of
operation of UNIKOM has been generally calm except for a tense situation
last January, following a series of actions by Iraq.  Subsequently, the
Security Council decided on a phased strengthening of UNIKOM, in the
first phase by a mechanized infantry battalion.  Owing to the greatly
increased commitments by Member States to United Nations peace-keeping
operations elsewhere, the Council's decision remains unfulfilled.

357.    Because of the efforts of the Special Commission and the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iraq's ability to pose a
threat to its neighbours by producing or possessing weapons of mass
destruction has been steadily diminishing.  However, Iraq has yet to
fulfil its commitment to provide the full, final and complete disclosure
of all aspects of its programmes that is needed to assess adequately its
capabilities and facilities.  A secure environment can be assured only
through long-term monitoring and verification of Iraq's unconditional
obligation not to use, retain, possess, develop, construct or otherwise
acquire items prohibited under Security Council resolution 687 (1991).

358.    Under resolution 687 (1991), the disposal of
nuclear-weapons-usable materials in Iraq is required.  Early in 1992,
IAEA assembled a multi-disciplinary team, comprising experts from IAEA
and representatives from the Special Commission and the Office of Legal
Affairs, to implement that mandate.  After lengthy negotiations a
complex contract was concluded in late June 1993 with the Committee for
International Relations of the Ministry of Atomic Energy (CIR-Minatom),
a State entity of the Russian Federation, which provided for the removal
and reprocessing of the materials and for the permanent storage of the
resulting wastes.

359.    With regard to the suffering of the Iraqi civilian population,
the United Nations has continued to make every effort to assist those
most in need, often at great personal risk to relief workers.  The
inter-agency humanitarian assistance programme in Iraq has, from April
1991 to March 1993, brought relief aid to the Iraqi civilian population
throughout the country.  The programme was developed in response to
Security Council resolution 688 (1991), in which the Council recognized
the pressing need for assistance, particularly to the 1.9 million Iraqis
in the north and south of the country.  To date, some $700 million have
been raised through United Nations appeals to finance projects
implemented by United Nations and non-governmental organizations.  The
humanitarian programmes in Iraq have been implemented within the
framework of a series of memoranda of understanding which also provide
for the deployment of the United Nations Guards Contingent in Iraq.  The
various phases of the programme share one goal, namely, a focus on
meeting basic needs for food, water, medical drugs and equipment and
shelter for Iraq's most vulnerable civilian population.

360.    The Legal Counsel was requested on 19 May 1993 by the Chairman
of the Security Council Committee established under resolution 661
(1990) to provide his opinion whether Iraq's frozen assets might be used
as payment for the sale or supply to Iraq of medicine and health
supplies, foodstuffs and materials and supplies for essential civilian
needs approved by the Committee, within the scope of the pertinent
Security Council resolutions, and, if so, under which conditions.  The
Legal Counsel responded by a letter dated 4 June 1993 to the Chairman of
the Committee in which he reviewed the legal regime applicable to frozen
Iraqi assets in the light of Security Council resolutions 661 (1990),
687 (1991), 706 (1991), 712 (1991) and 778 (1992).

361.    At the end of June 1993, I met the Deputy Prime Minister of
Iraq, Tariq Aziz; a fourth round of talks between the United Nations
Secretariat and the Government of Iraq was then held at United Nations
Headquarters from 7 to 15 July 1993.  The purpose was to reach an
understanding on practical arrangements for the implementation of the
scheme relating to the sale of Iraqi oil, provided for in Security
Council resolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991), and in my report of 4
September 1991 (S/23006).  Ten meetings were held during that round of
talks.  The delegation of the United Nations was led by the
Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs and Legal Counsel, and the
delegation of Iraq by Riyadh Al-Qaysi, Under-Secretary-General at the
Ministry for Foreign Affairs.  On 15 July 1993, the talks were
suspended.

362.    I continued to facilitate the return of Kuwaiti property seized
by Iraq in accordance with paragraph 15 of Security Council resolution
687 (1991).  I am pleased to report that, in carrying out this task, I
received full cooperation from the Governments of Iraq and Kuwait.

363.    The Commission established to administer the United Nations
Compensation Fund provided for in paragraph 18 of Security Council
resolution 687 (1991) has held four sessions since August 1992.  The
legal rules and procedures which govern the Commission's activities have
been drawn up and approved.  The first compensation commissioners have
been appointed, and they will begin the examination and evaluation of
the first category of claims in the next few months.

364.    It may be recalled that, in accordance with Security Council
resolution 706 (1991), the United Nations established an escrow account
into which the proceeds of the sale of Iraqi petroleum and petroleum
products, and voluntary contributions, were to be paid.  As at 1
September 1993, approximately $195 million had been deposited in that
account.  The funds have been designated to pay for the costs of the
Special Commission, the Compensation Fund, the return of all Kuwaiti
property, the Boundary Commission and humanitarian activities in Iraq.

365.    Recently a new programme of humanitarian assistance for the
period from 1 April 1993 to 31 March 1994 has been prepared to provide
rehabilitation assistance designed to limit further deterioration of
living conditions throughout Iraq.  The aim is to facilitate
self-sufficiency by promoting community-level projects.  That programme
includes specific project proposals from various United Nations
organizations and programmes amounting to $489 million.  The programme's
current lack of funding jeopardizes the implementation of crucial
rehabilitation activities, thereby prolonging the state of dependency
and degradation of the living conditions of the Iraqi Kurds and the
other vulnerable population groups in the country.

366.    On 1 September 1993 I met Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz to
urge Iraqi compliance across the range of outstanding issues.

        11.  Lebanon

367.    In southern Lebanon, there has been an increase in hostilities
between Israeli forces and armed elements who have proclaimed their
resistance to Israeli occupation.  The United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) has done its best to limit the conflict and to protect
the inhabitants from its effects.  In resolution 852 (1993), the
Security Council reaffirmed the mandate of UNIFIL as defined in its
resolution 425 (1978) and other relevant resolutions, which is to
confirm the withdrawal of Israeli forces, restore international peace
and security, and assist the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the
return of its effective authority in the area.  Although UNIFIL has not
been able to make visible progress towards these objectives, its
contribution to stability and the protection it is able to afford the
population of the area remain important.

368.    The volatility of the situation manifested itself in a
particularly grave escalation of hostilities in July 1993 when, in
response to rocket attacks against northern Israel, the Israeli Defence
Forces launched massive air strikes against southern Lebanon.  The
fighting caused the displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians;
dozens of Lebanese villages were destroyed or damaged; countless homes,
schools, hospitals, roads and bridges were demolished.  On 30 July 1993,
in a letter to the President of the Security Council, I drew attention
to the fact that the hostilities had severely affected the operations of
UNIFIL, whose mandate had been extended by the Security Council two days
earlier.  The heavy bombardment of the UNIFIL area of operations by
Israeli aircraft and artillery had inter alia hit the Nepalese battalion
headquarters and positions in the Irish and Finnish battalion sectors.
Fortunately, there were no serious casualties.  After the cessation of
hostilities, units of the Lebanese army were deployed in parts of the
UNIFIL area of operation for the purpose of maintaining public order.

369.    In these circumstances, I requested the Under-Secretary-General
for Humanitarian Affairs to act swiftly to coordinate the efforts of the
United Nations system in the provision of emergency humanitarian
assistance.  A consolidated appeal for immediate assistance in the
amount of $28.5 million was launched on 20 August.  To start up urgent
emergency work, advances of $5 million and $2 million from the Central
Emergency Revolving Fund were made available to Habitat and WFP,
respectively.

        12.  Liberia

370.    In view of the ongoing conflict in Liberia and the continuing
destruction and loss of life, the Security Council, in its resolution
788 (1992) of 19 November 1992, called upon all parties to the conflict
in Liberia to respect and implement the cease-fire and the various
accords of the peace process; decided, under Chapter VII of the Charter
of the United Nations, that all States should, for the purposes of
establishing peace and stability in Liberia, immediately implement a
general and complete embargo on all deliveries of weapons and military
equipment to Liberia, with the exception of weapons and military
equipment destined for the sole use of the peace-keeping forces of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS); and requested me to
dispatch a Special Representative to Liberia to evaluate the situation.

371.    In late 1992 and early 1993, my Special Representative, Trevor
Gordon-Somers, visited Liberia and held extensive discussions there and
in States members of ECOWAS.  On the basis of his findings, I submitted
a special report to the Security Council on 12 March 1993.  The Council,
in resolution 813 (1993) of 26 March 1993, reaffirmed its belief that
the Yamoussoukro IV Accord offered the best possible framework for a
peaceful resolution of the conflict in Liberia and its support for
increased humanitarian assistance to Liberia; demanded that the parties
concerned refrain from any action that would impede or obstruct the
delivery of humanitarian assistance; and called upon them to ensure the
safety of all personnel involved in international humanitarian
assistance.

372.    After the discovery of the massacre of innocent displaced
persons at Harbel on 6 June, the Security Council on 9 June 1993
requested me to commence an investigation and warned that those found
responsible would be held accountable for the serious violation of
international humanitarian law.  My Special Representative proceeded to
Monrovia to conduct a thorough investigation into the incident.
Preliminary action was taken by other United Nations officials on the
spot.  Since the first stage of the investigation, and after
consultations, I have appointed a panel of inquiry, which is now
undertaking a more comprehensive investigation of the massacre.  As soon
as the investigation is completed, I shall submit a full report to the
Security Council.

373.    During the protracted conflict in Liberia, the United Nations
provided assistance to over 700,000 Liberian refugees in neighbouring
countries, to 100,000 internally displaced Liberians and to some 100,000
destitute Sierra Leoneans who had sought refuge in Liberia.  As a result
of the emergency relief programme which has been carried out by the
United Nations and its non-governmental organization partners since
December 1990, severe malnutrition has been eliminated except in
isolated pockets, and the health of the population has improved
significantly.  However, since the resumption of hostilities in August
1992, the humanitarian situation has deteriorated.  Masses of people
have been displaced and large areas of the country have become
inaccessible to relief agencies.

374.    The conflicting parties agreed, at Geneva, after a week of
negotiations conducted under the joint auspices of ECOWAS, OAU and the
United Nations, to restore peace to the country.  The peace agreement,
which was signed on 25 July 1993 at an ECOWAS summit meeting at Cotonou,
Benin, calls on the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to continue its
peace-keeping role in Liberia and on the United Nations to play a
monitoring role through the establishment of an observer mission.  The
agreement also provides for the establishment of a broadly based central
transitional government, to be replaced by a democratically elected body
within seven months.  Agreement was also reached on the provision of
humanitarian relief to all Liberians in need through the most direct
routes, which has facilitated the delivery of humanitarian assistance to
the affected population.  United Nations organizations have been asked
to initiate the rapid voluntary repatriation and reintegration from
neighbouring countries of the more than 700,000 refugees.  The
Department of Humanitarian Affairs is preparing an inter-agency
consolidated appeal for Liberia.

375.    The Security Council, in its resolution 856 (1993) of 10 August
1993, decided to establish the United Nations Observer Mission in
Liberia (UNOMIL) and approved the sending of an advance team of 30
military observers to participate in the work of the Joint Cease-fire
Monitoring Committee.

        13.  Libyan Arab Jamahiriya

376.    In an effort to prevent a dangerous deterioration of the
situation regarding suspected Libyan involvement in the bombing of Pan
Am flight 103 and UTA flight 772, and to facilitate the implementation
of Security Council resolutions 731 (1992) and 748 (1992), I have
remained in almost constant contact over the past seven months with the
parties to the dispute and the League of Arab States.  I met the Foreign
Minister of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya at Cairo in July 1993 and in New
York in August in an attempt to resolve the dispute.  I have on five
occasions sent a personal envoy to Tripoli and intend to pursue every
effort to facilitate a just settlement in accordance with the mandate
given to me by the Security Council.

        14.  The Middle East

377.    In the course of the past year, the plight of the Palestinian
people living under occupation has not been alleviated.  There has,
moreover, been a dramatic worsening of the human rights situation in the
occupied territories.  In a particularly grave incident, Israel deported
over 400 Palestinian civilians to southern Lebanon in December 1992.
The Security Council, in its resolution 799 (1992), inter alia
reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to all the
Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including
Jerusalem, demanded that Israel ensure the safe and immediate return to
the occupied territories of all those deported, and requested me to send
a representative to the area and to report to the Council.  Conscious of
the possible effect of that event on the fragile process of Arab-Israeli
peace negotiations, and with a view to finding a solution, I dispatched
several missions to the area, led respectively by the
Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs and my Special Political
Adviser.  I had a number of meetings and telephone conversations with
leaders in the region and representatives of interested Governments.
Regrettably, those efforts were not successful and, in my report to the
Security Council of 25 January 1993 (S/25149), I recommended that the
Council should take whatever measures were required to ensure that its
unanimous decision was respected.

378. I have also been seriously alarmed by the reports of the rapid
worsening of the socio-economic situation in the occupied territories.
As the Palestinian economy is weak and highly dependent on that of
Israel, the livelihood of the Palestinian communities suffered further
damage when Israel closed off the occupied territories in March 1993.  I
have appealed to the international community to provide greater economic
assistance to the occupied territories.  In this connection, I have also
reminded the major donors of the critical financial situation of the
United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the
Near East.

379.    Because of the long-standing commitment of the United Nations to
a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement in the Middle East, based
on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), I welcomed
the invitation extended in October 1992 by the co-sponsors of the Middle
East peace process for the participation of the United Nations as a full
extraregional participant in the multilateral working groups on
environment, economic and regional development, water, refugees, arms
control and regional security in the Middle East.  Representatives of
the United Nations attended and took an active part in the meetings of
the working groups held in October-November 1992 in Paris, The Hague and
Ottawa and in April-May 1993 in Geneva, Rome, Oslo, Washington and
Tokyo.  In November 1992, I appointed Chinmaya Gharekhan as my Special
Representative at the multilateral talks.

380.    The United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) has
continued to supervise the separation between the Israeli and Syrian
forces, and the limitation of armaments and forces provided for in the
disengagement agreement of 1974.  With the cooperation of both sides,
UNDOF has discharged its tasks effectively and its area of operation has
been quiet.

381.    The United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), which
is the oldest existing peace-keeping operation, has continued to assist
UNDOF and UNIFIL in carrying out their tasks and has maintained its
presence in Egypt.  During the last year, the personnel of UNTSO has
been reduced by 25 per cent.

        15.  Mozambique

382.    The signing in Rome of the General Peace Agreement between the
Government of Mozambique and the Resistência Nacional Moçambicana
(RENAMO) in October 1992 brought renewed hope to this war-torn country.
The United Nations was called upon to play a central role in the
implementation of various aspects of the Agreement.  The mandate of the
United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ), since its establishment
in December 1992, as coordinated by my Special Representative, Aldo
Ajello, is to monitor cease-fire arrangements and the demobilization of
up to 100,000 soldiers from both sides, to fulfil political and
electoral functions, to conduct a massive humanitarian operation and to
organize mine clearance.

383.    As part of the peace-building efforts in Mozambique, a meeting
of donors was held at Maputo on 8 and 9 June 1993, under the joint
chairmanship of the Government of Italy and the United Nations.  The
meeting, which followed the Donors Conference on Mozambique held in Rome
on 15 and 16 December 1992 on the basis of article VII of the General
Peace Agreement, reviewed the progress made in the implementation of the
consolidated humanitarian assistance programme in Mozambique.  That
programme reflects a shift from the previous concentration on emergency
relief; by focusing on the reintegration needs of refugees and displaced
persons, leading to reconstruction and future development, it signals
the end of a protracted emergency phase and the beginning of a return to
normalcy.  The humanitarian assistance programme encompasses support for
the repatriation process, the demobilization of armed units, emergency
relief, restoration of essential services and balance-of-payments and
budget support.  The programme will require $559.6 million for the
period from May 1993 to April 1994.  The repatriation and resettlement
of 1.5 million Mozambicans, now living as refugees in neighbouring
countries, will be the largest such operation undertaken in Africa under
United Nations auspices.

384.    While donors have since announced new pledges totalling some $70
million, thereby increasing the total value of pledges to $520 million,
against the programme's total requirements of $560 million, they have
also expressed concern about delays related to the electoral process,
demobilization and the work of certain commissions identified in the
General Peace Agreement.  The positive participation of all concerned
parties in the implementation of the Agreement will contribute
significantly to the strengthening of peace in Mozambique.

385.    In June 1993 I reported to the Security Council that the delays
which had impeded the rapid deployment of the ONUMOZ military component
had been overcome and that, by the beginning of May 1993, the five
infantry battalions provided for in my operational plan had been fully
deployed along the Beira, Tete, Limpopo and Nacala corridors and along
national highway N1.  Since then, the deployment of all contingents has
been completed.  At the end of August 1993 the total strength of the
formed units, including support elements, was over 6,000.

386.    As envisaged, the operations of the contingents chiefly involve
the conducting of motorized and air patrols along the corridors,
establishing checkpoints and providing escorts for trains.  United
Nations troops have also escorted road convoys carrying relief food to
populations in need in various regions, and transported equipment to
assembly areas.  In addition, they have carried out repair and
reconnaissance of roads, both in populated locations and en route to
assembly areas.

387.    The process of assembly and demobilization of Government and
RENAMO forces scheduled to begin in mid-November 1992 has been delayed
for several reasons, particularly the insistence of RENAMO on receiving
financial support as a political party before participating in the work
of the commissions and its insistence that 65 per cent of ONUMOZ troops
be deployed before the assembly process begins.

388.    As at 25 August 1993, 303 of the authorized total number of 354
military observers had arrived in Mozambique.  Assisted by troops from
the contingents, the observers are now actively involved in the
establishment and preparation of assembly areas, conducting inspections
and investigations of cease-fire violation complaints.

389.    In late August 1993 I was able to report an important
development, namely, the arrival at Maputo, after several postponements,
of Mr. Afonso Dhlakama, President of RENAMO, and the start on 21 August
of a series of meetings between him and the President of Mozambique, Mr.
Joaquim Chissano.  It is widely expected that the meetings will continue
until some form of agreement has been reached on major outstanding
issues.  The importance of this development cannot be overemphasized.
Progress in many major areas of the peace process depends on the
successful outcome of these discussions.

        16.  Republic of Moldova

390.    After the signature of the disengagement agreement on 21 July
1992, and acting on a request from the President of the Republic of
Moldova, I sent a second fact-finding mission to that country in late
August 1992.  The mission concluded that, despite the cessation of armed
hostilities, prevailing conditions remained fragile.

391.    A major stumbling-block continues to be the question of the
withdrawal of the Fourteenth Russian Army from the left bank of the
Dniester.  In a letter dated 2 October 1992 to the Secretary-General,
the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Moldova proposed the
dispatch of United Nations observers, with the consent of the Russian
Federation, to the negotiations between the two countries on the
withdrawal of the Fourteenth Army.  In my response of 5 January 1993, I
offered to send a mission to meet the leaders of the Moldovan and
Russian delegations to the negotiations and to discuss possible
arrangements for the presence there of United Nations observers.

392.    In view of the establishment in the Republic of Moldova of an
eight-member mission of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in
Europe on 27 April 1993, an understanding has been reached with the
Government that CSCE will take the leading role in the issue.

        17.  Rwanda

393.    United Nations observers have been deployed to one side of a
common border with the agreement of the two States involved, namely,
Rwanda and Uganda.  In my interim report to the Security Council on
Rwanda, of 20 May 1993 (S/25810) following the mission of my
representative, I proposed the establishment of a United Nations
observer mission on the Ugandan side of the Rwanda-Uganda border.  In
recommending the deployment of United Nations observers, I noted that a
decision to deploy observers to the border would highlight the
international community's interest in peace and security in the area,
could help to promote the negotiation process at Arusha and would
encourage the parties actively to pursue their efforts for peace and
national reconciliation in Rwanda.

394.    The Security Council, in its resolution 846 (1993), taking note
of the requests of the Governments of Rwanda and Uganda for the
deployment of United Nations observers along their common border as a
temporary confidence-building measure, decided to establish the United
Nations Observer Mission Uganda-Rwanda (UNOMUR), with the task of
verifying that no military assistance is provided across the border
between the two countries.  At the same time, the United Nations is
providing emergency relief assistance to the 900,000 persons displaced
by the conflict.  A consolidated appeal for $78 million has been
launched for this humanitarian programme.

395.    The cease-fire agreement reached on 12 July 1992 was broken on 8
February 1993 but restored on 9 March.  Two United Nations military
experts were placed at the disposal of the Organization of African
Unity, to provide it with technical assistance in the preparation of a
submission to donors for the funding of an expanded Neutral Military
Observer Group in Rwanda.  That Group has been monitoring the
cease-fire.  The latest phase of the talks began in mid-March 1993 and
has now been completed.  A comprehensive peace agreement was signed at
Arusha on 4 August 1993.  The role of the United Republic of Tanzania,
as facilitator in the negotiations, was important for their successful
completion.

396.    Taking into account the communications received from the
President of Rwanda and the OAU Secretary-General and in pursuance of
resolution 846 (1993), I have sent a reconnaissance mission to Rwanda to
examine the possible function of the neutral international force called
for by the Government of Rwanda and the Rwandese Patriotic Front and to
evaluate the human and financial resources that would be needed to carry
them out.  The findings of the mission, which will also hold
consultations with OAU and the Government of the United Republic of
Tanzania, will assist me in making recommendations to the Security
Council regarding the United Nations contribution to the implementation
of the Peace Agreement.

        18.  Tajikistan

397.    During the summer of 1992, the number of armed clashes between
various groups increased dramatically and by late August and early
September 1992 fighting raged across southern Tajikistan.  Concerned
that events might lead to a wider regional conflict, I dispatched, in
consultation with the Governments of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, a
fact-finding mission from 16 to 22 September 1992.  It reported, inter
alia, that the situation in Tajikistan was that of a civil war, and that
since June 1992 more than 2,000 people had been killed and more than
200,000 had become refugees or displaced persons.

398.    I consequently dispatched a goodwill mission to Tajikistan and
four neighbouring countries, from 3 to 14 November 1992, to assist and
support regional peacemaking efforts.  The mission also carried out a
preliminary assessment of humanitarian needs and its report formed the
basis of a preliminary appeal for $20 million to support the
humanitarian programmes of UNHCR, WFP and WHO.  In the light of the
mission's consultations with the various interlocutors in the region, I
informed the Security Council on 21 December 1992 of my decision to
establish a small, integrated United Nations unit at Dushanbe to monitor
the situation on the ground and to provide liaison services.  My
decision was welcomed by the Government of Tajikistan.

399.    Early in 1993, I appointed, for a period of three months, a
Special Envoy to Tajikistan, Ismat Kittani, whose mandate was to obtain
agreement on a cease-fire with appropriate international monitoring,
begin negotiations for a political solution, and enlist the help of
neighbouring countries and others concerned in achieving those
objectives.  That appointment was welcomed by the Security Council.

400.    In May and June 1993, my Special Envoy visited the Islamic
Republic of Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, the Russian
Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and, a few weeks later, Saudi
Arabia for talks with their leaders.  During that initial mission he was
not able to complete his contacts and ascertain the positions of all
concerned parties in accordance with his mandate.  On 16 August 1993, I
submitted a report to the Security Council summarizing the Special
Envoy's findings, and expressed my concern about the escalating crisis
on the Afghan-Tajik border.  In a statement made by its President on 23
August 1993, the Security Council welcomed my proposal to extend the
mandate of my Special Envoy until 31 October 1993 and to extend, by
three months, the tenure of United Nations officials currently in
Tajikistan.

401.    I have asked my Special Envoy to visit Kabul as soon as possible
for discussions with government leaders regarding his mandate in
Tajikistan and to ascertain the views and positions of the Tajik
opposition leaders residing in Afghanistan.  In addition, I requested
him to undertake a second mission to Dushanbe and to visit other
regional countries.  Meanwhile, I have informed the Security Council of
my concern about recent developments and my intention to monitor the
situation closely.  The Department of Humanitarian Affairs is carrying
out an inter-agency re-evaluation of the humanitarian needs of
Tajikistan.

        19.  Western Sahara

402.    In April 1991, the Security Council decided, in resolution 690
(1991), to establish a United Nations Mission for the Referendum in
Western Sahara (MINURSO).  The resolution provided for a referendum for
self-determination to be organized by the United Nations in cooperation
with the Organization of African Unity.  The mission will consist of
civilian, security and military units functioning as an integrated
operation.  The civilian unit of MINURSO is expected to comprise
approximately 275 international staff members, the security unit up to
300 police officers and the military unit approximately 1,700 military
personnel, including observers and infantry and logistics battalions.
Differences have arisen with respect to the criteria relating to voter
eligibility.  I have been in close contact with both parties, and I
visited the area from 31 May to 4 June 1993, accompanied by my Special
Representative, Sahabzada Yaqub-Khan, in order to urge the parties to
accept a compromise solution with regard to the interpretation and
application of those criteria.

403.    Notwithstanding difficulties in the preparation and organization
of direct talks between the parties and other problems, mostly of a
procedural nature, the delegations of Morocco and the Frente Polisario
met from 17 to 19 July at Laayoune, in the presence of my Special
Representative as United Nations observer.  The dialogue was held in a
positive spirit, marked by restraint and mutual respect.  It is my
earnest hope that the talks will be resumed soon as a follow-up to the
Laayoune initiative, and that the referendum will take place before the
end of the year.

        20.  Zaire

404.    With respect to the situation in Zaire, I transmitted to the
President of the Security Council, on 7 May 1993, a letter dated 24
March 1993 from Etienne Tshisekedi, the Prime Minister elected by the
Sovereign National Conference, requesting the United Nations to appoint
observers to safeguard respect for human rights; to assist in the
preparation, monitoring and supervision of truly free and democratic
elections; and to dispatch an evaluation mission to Shaba with a view to
the provision of humanitarian assistance for people displaced within
their own country.  Mr. Tshisekedi also requested the dispatch of a
United Nations intervention force to Zaire to restore law and order,
peace and internal security, to ensure the protection of people and
property, and to avert the possibility of a civil war.  I also informed
the President of the Security Council that I had met at Brussels on 23
April 1993 Monseigneur Laurent Monsengwo, President of the High Council
of the Republic of Zaire, to discuss the deteriorating situation and the
institutional stalemate in that country, and the possibility of a role
for the United Nations.

405.    The humanitarian situation continues to be very serious, with
the number of displaced persons reaching into the hundreds of thousands.
Locally based United Nations and non-governmental organizations are
doing their utmost to provide the necessary relief assistance.  I
decided to organize an inter-agency needs assessment mission, to obtain
a first-hand appreciation of the humanitarian and related needs and to
consult with all concerned on means of providing assistance to the
affected population, in particular the displaced people.  That mission
did not take place because of reservations expressed by President
Mobutu.

406.    During the OAU summit meeting at Cairo in July 1993, I had the
opportunity to hold extensive discussions with President Mobutu.  I then
appointed my Special Envoy for Zaire, Lakhdar Brahimi, to undertake a
goodwill mission, having as its principal objective the exploration of
ways and means for the United Nations to assist in finding a solution to
the current political situation.  I have been assured by President
Mobutu that my Special Envoy will have his full cooperation and the
freedom to travel to any part of the country, as well as to meet with
the opposition parties.

407.    My Special Envoy arrived in Zaire on 18 July.  He met President
Mobutu in Shaba and exchanged views with Prime Minister Faustin Birindwa
and senior officials of his Government.  He also met Etienne Tshisekedi,
Monseigneur Monsengwo and leaders of the opposition parties.  Mr.
Brahimi was very well received by all his interlocutors and made every
effort to encourage a dialogue among the parties, in order to put an end
to the violence and facilitate national reconciliation.

408.    After the return of Mr. Brahimi to New York at the beginning of
August 1993, I sent an inter-agency mission to Zaire to assess urgent
humanitarian requirements, particularly in regions of concentration of
internally displaced persons, and to identify ways of addressing those
needs effectively.  Besides the Kinshasa area, the mission is planning
to visit the provinces of Shaba, North Kivu and West and East Kasai, and
is expected to complete its work within three weeks.  In the interim, I
alerted the United Nations organizations concerned, and the donor
community, to the need for an increased effort to alleviate the plight
of the affected populations, particularly in the provinces of Shaba and
Kivu.

       E.  Major comprehensive efforts

409.    As the foregoing examples demonstrate, the range of
responsibilities facing the new United Nations is not only vast but
virtually open-ended, extending to almost every area of human activity.

410.    To cope with this revolutionary and novel situation, the United
Nations must address its challenges in the most coherent and
comprehensive way possible.  Governments and private individuals must
also realize that crises such as those just discussed transcend
traditional boundaries of theory and practice.  Food, water, land-mines,
disease and death, and democratization, human rights and development are
inextricably intertwined.  Efforts to deal with particular issues cannot
succeed in the absence of a comprehensive vision of the whole.

411.    Four current cases will illustrate the comprehensive and
challenging situations in which the United Nations is engaged:
Cambodia, El Salvador, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia.  They resemble
each other in the all-encompassing nature of the tasks they demand, but
each involves distinct and different factors.

        1.  Cambodia

412.    The successful conduct of the recent election in Cambodia
represents an affirmation of the important contribution United Nations
peace-keeping operations can make to resolving complicated situations
even in the face of serious obstacles.  The mandate of the United
Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC), set out in the Paris
Agreements, was one of the most complex and ambitious ever undertaken by
a United Nations operation.  It included aspects relating to human
rights, the organization and conduct of free and fair general elections,
military arrangements, civil administration, the maintenance of law and
order, the repatriation and resettlement of the Cambodian refugees and
displaced persons, and the rehabilitation of essential Cambodian
infrastructures during the transitional period.  At the same time it was
planned as a peace-keeping operation in the time-honoured tradition, an
operation based on the agreement and cooperation of the parties, relying
on political authority and persuasion rather than on force.

413.    When one of the four Cambodian parties that had signed the
Agreements and undertaken a range of obligations, the Party of
Democratic Kampuchea, refused to honour its commitments, UNTAC was faced
with grave difficulties.  Indeed, that party, after its early refusal to
implement Phase II of the cease-fire and to demobilize its troops under
UNTAC supervision, progressively withdrew from the peace process,
absenting itself from meetings of the Supreme National Council.  Despite
my continued efforts and those of my Special Representative, Yasushi
Akashi, and of the Co-Chairmen of the Paris Conference and other
concerned Governments to engage it in a dialogue, it eventually refused
to participate in the election.  I resolved nevertheless to go forward
in implementing all aspects of the mandate of UNTAC to the maximum
extent possible.  I was determined not to allow the non-cooperation of
one party to negate the unprecedented and far-reaching international
efforts to restore peace to Cambodia.

414.    The Security Council consistently supported this course of
action.  While the cantonment of forces had to be suspended after some
55,000 of the approximately 200,000 troops belonging to the three
factions cooperating in the peace process had been regrouped and
cantoned, the 16,000-member military component of UNTAC redeployed
itself to focus on providing security for voter registration and later
for the election itself in all 21 provinces.  With full deployment of
its 21,000 military, police and civilian personnel achieved by mid-1992,
UNTAC vigorously pursued its manifold tasks of promoting respect for
human rights, contributing to the maintenance of law and order and
exercising control and supervision of the activities of the existing
administrative structures, especially in the five key areas of foreign
affairs, national defence, finance, public security and information.  An
active education and information campaign was a vital aspect of those
efforts.

415.    The successful repatriation of more than 360,000 refugees and
displaced persons by 31 March 1993, exactly a year after the process
began and in spite of major logistic and climatic impediments, was a
testimony to the organizational capacity of UNTAC and the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which served as the lead
agency within an integrated effort, and to the faith that the returning
Cambodians had in a future in their homeland.

416.    The Cambodian people at large repeatedly manifested their faith
in the peace process and their courage and determination to build a
stable future by first registering for and then massively voting in the
election, which was held on schedule from 23 to 28 May 1993.  Nearly 4.7
million people, or some 96 per cent of the estimated eligible
population, registered to vote.  A total of 4,267,192, representing
nearly 90 per cent of the registered voters, cast their ballot.  Despite
concerns about disruption by the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea,
and about earlier acts of intimidation attributed largely to another
party, both the six-week election campaign, in which 20 political
parties actively took part, and the polling itself, proved to be
remarkably peaceful and free of violent incidents.  The UNTAC electoral
staff, who were joined by more than 50,000 Cambodian electoral workers
and 1,000 international polling station officers, were moved by the
enthusiasm, patience and buoyant spirit manifested by the Cambodian
voters everywhere during the election.

417.    On 10 June, after the verification and counting of the ballots
had been completed, my Special Representative declared, with my
authorization and on my behalf, that the election in Cambodia had been
free and fair.  The Security Council endorsed that determination on 15
June, and the results of the election have now been accepted by all the
Cambodian parties.  The newly elected Constituent Assembly held its
inaugural meeting on 14 June to begin its task of drafting and adopting
a new Constitution and establishing the new Government of Cambodia.

418.    Since then, the four Cambodian political parties that won seats
in the election have agreed to join in a joint interim administration,
under the leadership of His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, for
the remainder of the transitional period until the creation of the new
Government in accordance with the Paris Agreements.  I welcomed and
supported this step as contributing to stability, national
reconciliation and a smooth transition to the future Government of
Cambodia.

419.    UNTAC will continue faithfully to fulfil its mandate for the
remainder of the transitional period and will do its utmost to help the
Cambodian people to consolidate their victory in this impressive feat of
self-determination.  I am convinced that the international community
will not fail to continue to assist the people of Cambodia and their
future Government in the arduous task of building a stable, peaceful and
prosperous future.

420.    More than 20,000 United Nations troops began leaving Cambodia in
August 1993, ending one of the largest operations in the history of the
Organization.  On 27 August 1993 the Security Council, in its resolution
860 (1993), fixed the date of 15 November 1993 as the deadline for the
withdrawal of the military component of UNTAC.

        2.  El Salvador

421.    El Salvador is another Member State where the United Nations is
engaged in an operation of considerable complexity.  The Organization
mediated a series of peace agreements between the Government and the
Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional (FMLN) and then
assumed responsibility for assisting and verifying their implementation.
The United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL), which was
created for that purpose and is headed by my Special Representative
Augusto Ramírez-Ocampo, comprises military observers, police officers,
human rights experts and a variety of experts in other civilian
disciplines.  It will soon have added to it an Electoral Division to
observe, at the request of the Government of El Salvador, the elections
which are to be held in the spring of 1994 and which will mark the
culmination of the peace process.

422.    The multidisciplinary nature of ONUSAL reflects the complexity
of the peace agreements, which provided, even before a cease-fire came
into effect, for United Nations monitoring of respect for human rights
by both sides.  A Commission of three distinguished non-Salvadorians was
appointed to establish the truth about certain grave acts of violence
committed during more than 10 years of bitter civil war.  There was to
be a cease-fire; the purification and progressive reduction of the armed
forces; and the demobilization of FMLN and its legalization as a
political party.  The existing public security bodies were to be
monitored by the United Nations and a new national civil police formed.
The judicial system was to be reformed, as was the electoral system.  A
variety of amendments were to be made to the Constitution in order to
ensure, in particular, that the Army and other security forces were
fully under civilian control and that the Army would not be involved in
police functions, such as the preservation of internal order, except in
exceptional circumstances.  Reforms were to take place in the economic
and social spheres.  In particular, land was to be provided for
ex-combatants from both sides as they demobilized and for persons who
during the war had taken over and worked land owned by others.

423.    It is to the credit of the Salvadorian people, in particular of
the Government and FMLN, that it rapidly became clear that the peace
process was irreversible.  There have nevertheless been some set-backs
in its implementation.  The cease-fire was impeccably observed but there
was an eight-month delay in the Government's implementation of the
recommendations of the Ad Hoc Commission set up to purify the armed
forces.  Most seriously, the discovery of a substantial FMLN arms cache
in Nicaragua on 23 May 1993 revealed that, despite repeated
protestations to the contrary, FMLN had failed to declare and destroy
all its arms, ammunition and other war matériel.  During the following
three months FMLN revealed to ONUSAL further arms caches inside and
outside El Salvador, the contents of which were destroyed.  That serious
violation of the agreements put some strain on the peace process; I
trust that this chapter is now closed.

424.    In recent months there have been delays in the formation and
deployment of the new national civil police and a lack of progress in
implementing the recommendations of the Truth Commission, which
complemented the agreements and were intended to ensure that the
conditions which permitted gross violations of human rights during the
armed conflict would not recur.  I firmly believe that implementation of
those recommendations is necessary for national reconciliation.  

425.    There have also been delays in putting into effect the
complicated provisions of the peace agreements relating to land.  There
is an inescapable moral obligation to fulfil promises made to
demobilized combatants of both sides.  

426.    Like the delays in the formation of the national civil police,
the delays in the land programme are due partly to lack of financial
resources.  My appeals for financial support from the international
community have not so far produced all that is required.  I believe that
the Government has therefore an obligation to adjust its own expenditure
priorities to ensure that critical elements in the peace process do not
fail for want of finance; but it has to be acknowledged that this may
prove difficult to reconcile with the economic reform programme which is
a condition of continuing support for El Salvador on the part of the
international financial institutions.

427.    The case of El Salvador is a prime example of the need for a
fully integrated approach by the United Nations system as a whole to the
requirements of peace-building in countries emerging from long years of
armed conflict.  A cease-fire and a successful election are not enough
to claim success; that is only assured when the necessary political,
economic and social measures have been taken to eradicate the underlying
causes of the original conflict.

        3.  Somalia

428.    Despite the best efforts of the international community to help
Somalia with traditional peace-keeping and humanitarian assistance, the
situation had become intolerable by the end of 1992.  Somalia remained
without a central Government, Mogadishu was divided by rival militia,
and throughout the country a dozen or more factions were active.

429.    Widespread looting of aid supplies, robbery, armed banditry and
general lawlessness compounded the situation.  Large sums of cash and
relief aid were being extorted from donor organizations and the lives of
their personnel were being put in danger.  The result was that, while
relief supplies were ready and in the pipeline, they were prevented from
reaching Somalis dying of starvation.  According to some estimates, as
many as 3,000 persons a day were dying of starvation in Somalia, while
warehouses remained stocked.

430.    On 24 November 1992, I reported to the Security Council that I
did not exclude the possibility that it might become necessary to review
the basic premises and principles of the United Nations effort in
Somalia.  I also reported that traditional peace-keeping efforts were
not yielding the desired results and that it might become necessary to
resort to measures of peace-enforcement.

431.    On 3 December 1992, the Security Council, by its resolution 794
(1992), established a precedent in the history of the United Nations:
it decided for the first time to intervene militarily for strictly
humanitarian purposes.  By that resolution the Council authorized the
use of all necessary means to establish as soon as possible a secure
environment for humanitarian relief operations in Somalia.  Acting under
Chapter VII of the Charter, the Council authorized the Secretary-General
and the Member States concerned to make arrangements for the unified
command and control of the forces involved, and called on all Member
States that were in a position to do so to provide military forces and
to make contributions in cash or in kind.  The Council further decided
that the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM I) should proceed
at my discretion in the light of my assessment of conditions on the
ground.

432.    In the first phase of the operation, the Unified Task Force,
spearheaded by the United States of America, began arriving on 9
December 1992 to establish a secure environment for the unimpeded
delivery of humanitarian assistance.  I urged the Task Force command to
take steps to disarm the factions involved in the fighting.  In the
course of five difficult months, the Task Force made progress in opening
up access to more and more remote areas and in providing protection for
the delivery of humanitarian assistance.  Disarmament remains a major
problem, but United Nations and non-governmental organizations were able
to expand their relief activities in various parts of the country.  As a
result, there was a dramatic fall in malnutrition levels and in the
numbers of deaths from starvation.

433.    On 3 March 1993, I submitted to the Security Council my
recommendations for effecting the transition from the Unified Task Force
to UNOSOM II.  I indicated that, since the adoption of Council
resolution 794 (1992), the Task Force had deployed approximately 37,000
troops, covering about 40 per cent of the country's territory.  While
the security situation had improved, incidents of violence continued to
occur; I therefore concluded that UNOSOM II should be endowed with
enforcement powers to enable it to establish a secure environment
throughout Somalia.

434.    On 26 March, in its resolution 814 (1993), the Security Council,
acting under Chapter VII of the Charter, set out the arrangements for
the transition from the Unified Task Force to a new United Nations
operation (UNOSOM II) under a changed mandate.  Instead of a return to
peace-keeping, as envisaged in its resolution 794 (1992), the Council
chose to set up an unprecedented operation involving, as necessary,
enforcement action by the United Nations itself under the authority of
the Security Council.

435.    In this second phase, UNOSOM II is called upon to continue the
restoration of peace, stability and law and order, to assist in the
re-establishment of the Somali police force, to provide security and
assistance in the repatriation of refugees and the resettlement of
displaced persons; to assist in the development of a programme for the
removal of mines throughout Somalia, to monitor the arms embargo and to
facilitate disarmament; and to assist in the provision of relief and in
the economic rehabilitation of Somalia.  The accelerated deployment of
all UNOSOM II contingents to meet the full requirement of 28,000
personnel, all ranks, as well as equipment, was encouraged by the
Security Council.  Member States were urged to contribute, on an
emergency basis, military support and transportation, including armoured
personnel carriers, tanks and attack helicopters, to enable UNOSOM II to
confront and deter armed attacks directed against it in carrying out its
mandate.  At 31 August 1993, the full target of 28,000 personnel had not
been reached.

436.    After the transfer of military command to UNOSOM II on 4 May
1993, some of the political movements staged armed attacks against
personnel of the operation, as a result of which 49 soldiers have lost
their lives.  Four journalists have also been killed, and about 160
UNOSOM personnel have been wounded.

437.    On 6 June 1993, the Security Council, by its resolution 837
(1993), reaffirmed the authority of the Secretary-General to take all
necessary measures against those responsible for the armed attacks and
for publicly inciting them, including their arrest and detention for
prosecution, trial and punishment.  The Council also demanded that all
Somali parties, including movements and factions, comply fully with
their commitments.  It re-emphasized the crucial importance of disarming
them and of neutralizing radio broadcasting systems that contributed to
the violence.

438.    In the course of the military action carried out by UNOSOM II
forces since 12 June, great care has been taken to avoid civilian
casualties.  The President of the Security Council and I have both
expressed deep regret and sorrow at the casualties which have occurred
among innocent Somali civilians.

439.    One major task that lies ahead for UNOSOM II and for the Somali
people is the implementation of the agreements signed at Addis Ababa in
January and March 1993, which include specific provisions regarding a
cease-fire, disarmament, demobilization and national reconciliation, as
well as requests for United Nations assistance in enforcing them.  Those
agreements are Somali agreements, and the responsibility for their
successful implementation lies with the Somali people.  Under Chapter
VII authority, UNOSOM II and my Special Representative in Somalia,
Admiral Jonathan Howe, will be there to assist and facilitate.

440.    The importance of security both for the effective delivery of
relief and for the transition to rehabilitation and reconstruction was
fully recognized at the Third Coordination Meeting on Humanitarian
Assistance for Somalia, held at Addis Ababa from 11 to 13 March 1993.
Participants endorsed the United Nations relief and rehabilitation
programme for 1993, which was developed in consultation with the
Somalis.  The meeting was attended by 190 Somalis, many of whom played
an active role in the proceedings of the Conference on National
Reconciliation in Somalia which I convened at Addis Ababa on 15 March
1993.

441.    At the Conference on National Reconciliation in Somalia, a
two-year transitional period was set by the Somali participants for the
re-establishment of a legitimate representative government.  In choosing
a target date of March 1995, Somalis have established for themselves a
realistic time-frame in which to restore civil institutions, to pursue
policies which will ensure economic recovery and to provide for their
own security.  It is my expectation that at the end of March 1995 the
current phase in Somalia's history will have come to a successful
conclusion and Somalia will have returned to normalcy.

442.    The United Nations is undertaking parallel efforts to put
together a three-year, medium-term reconstruction and development plan
for Somalia.  United Nations development organizations, including UNDP
and the World Bank, have been actively involved in this exercise, and
arrangements have been made to integrate the efforts of Somalis into
this plan.  I trust that those efforts will enable the Somalis to
rebuild a civil society in their country.

        4.  The former Yugoslavia

443.    The tragic situation in the former Yugoslavia continues to drain
the attention, resources, and emotion of the international community.
The Security Council is in session almost daily on this subject and, by
the end of July 1993, had adopted 44 resolutions and issued 33
statements by the President on the various conflicts there.  While the
Council's wishes have been repeatedly flouted by the parties on the
ground, I am encouraged by the fact that nations with vastly different
interests have been able to respond collectively, again and again, with
spontaneous and courageous initiatives, and that they have made valiant
attempts to bring tranquillity to that troubled region.

444.    Since August 1993, the International Conference on the Former
Yugoslavia has provided a permanent negotiating forum for seeking a
political solution to all the problems of the former Yugoslavia.  The
Conference has a Steering Committee, now chaired by Lord Owen,
representing the European Community, and Thorvald Stoltenberg, who in
May replaced my Personal Envoy, Cyrus Vance, and who also serves as my
Special Representative for the former Yugoslavia.  I should like to
place on record my gratitude for the tireless, selfless and dedicated
efforts of Mr. Vance during the time that he served as my Personal
Envoy.  The Vance-Owen Plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Vance
Plan for Croatia, still represent a basis for further political
solutions to the conflicts in those Member States.

445.    Meanwhile the peace-keeping challenge both in Croatia and in
Bosnia and Herzegovina has proved to be formidable.  The original
mandate of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was extended
three times at my suggestion, on 21 February, 31 March and 30 June 1993.
UNPROFOR now has almost 25,000 personnel - about 14,000 in Croatia,
nearly 10,000 in Bosnia, and slightly under 1,000 in the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia.  The experience of UNPROFOR in Bosnia and
Herzegovina and, to a lesser extent, in Croatia has raised serious
questions about the wisdom of deploying blue helmets in situations where
the parties are unable or unwilling to honour commitments they enter
into and where the peace-keepers themselves become targets of attack.

446.    In Croatia, the original United Nations peace plan remained
unimplemented in crucial respects.  Demilitarization of the United
Nations Protected Areas never took place because of the resistance of
local Serbian authorities, a resistance which was at times hardened by
the threat, or fear, of attack by the Croatian Army.  Consequently, the
return of refugees and displaced persons, which can be effected only in
secure circumstances, was repeatedly postponed, much to the dismay of
all concerned.  The mounting frustration of the Croatian Government with
the lack of progress in recovering its sovereign territory led to three
incursions against Serbs in sectors adjoining the area of deployment of
UNPROFOR, and set the peace process back even further.  At the time of
writing the situation remains tense.

447.    In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the considerable peace-keeping and
humanitarian effort of the international community has not brought an
end to the brutal conflict, and the daily horrors inflicted on suffering
civilians remain an affront to the world's conscience.

448.    The most visible and successful contribution of the
international community in the former Yugoslavia is in the humanitarian
sphere.  The United Nations relief effort, headed by UNHCR, includes
valuable contributions by UNICEF, the World Health Organization, the
World Food Programme, and other organizations including the
International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Organization
for Migration and numerous non-governmental organizations.

449.    In March, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees reported that 3.8 million people were receiving assistance in
the whole of the former Yugoslavia.  In Bosnia and Herzegovina alone,
some 2.28 million people, or half the original population, were
benefiting from UNHCR assistance.  UNPROFOR was able to facilitate the
delivery of some 40,000 tons of humanitarian aid to over 800,000
besieged civilians, and to provide help for a huge number of displaced
people in the area.  Its presence was invaluable in helping to avert the
mass starvation that many experts predicted would overtake Bosnia and
Herzegovina during the past winter.  The provision of relief has
involved negotiation of access routes, coordination of airlifting
supplies into Sarajevo, delivery of relief by road convoys, and the
organization of air drops of relief supplies to areas under siege not
accessible by road convoys.

450.    The conditions for the international community's humanitarian
efforts have steadily deteriorated, however.  In Bosnia and Herzegovina
there is currently widespread fighting.  Relief operations are
obstructed, sabotaged or diverted for military purposes, while the
personnel of UNPROFOR, UNHCR and other organizations are increasingly
targeted deliberately by members of the armed forces of all parties.
UNPROFOR has now incurred 548 casualties, including 51 fatalities, and
the casualty rate has recently increased significantly.  Meanwhile, the
support of the international community for humanitarian operations is
dwindling and the sums actually received fall far short of
requirements.

451.    The role of the United Nations and other organizations in Bosnia
and Herzegovina and the means at their disposal are therefore under
serious challenge.  It is obviously of paramount importance to sustain
the humanitarian effort for as long as necessary but there is a real
risk that, if the present downward spiral continues, it will be
impossible for the Security Council to achieve its political objectives
in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The ultimate consequences would be further
large population displacements, which could have serious destabilizing
effects on neighbouring countries and the region as a whole, and a
humanitarian catastrophe.

452.    One of the most heinous aspects of the war in the former
Yugoslavia is the massive and systematic violation of human rights, and
the grave violations of humanitarian law, particularly in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.  The Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights
has submitted several detailed reports on the situation, with
recommendations.  In his report of March 1993, he paid special attention
to mounting evidence of war crimes.

453.    In August 1992, the Security Council reaffirmed the individual
responsibility of those who committed or ordered the commission of grave
breaches of the Geneva Conventions and violations of international
humanitarian law in the former Yugoslavia.  On 6 October 1992, the
Council, in resolution 780 (1992), requested me to appoint a Commission
of Experts to reach conclusions on the evidence of grave breaches of the
Geneva Conventions and other violations of international humanitarian
law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia.  A five-member
Commission was established, which has held seven sessions since November
1992, compiled a computerized database, provided two interim reports and
conducted several field investigations.  The Office of Legal Affairs has
provided legal and administrative support services to the Commission.

454.    The initial findings of the Commission led the Security Council
to conclude that an international tribunal should be established for the
prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of
international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former
Yugoslavia since 1991.  By its resolution 808 (1993), the Council
requested me to prepare a report on all aspects of this matter,
including specific proposals for the establishment of such a tribunal.
I submitted the report, including a draft Statute, on 3 May 1993, and it
was approved in its entirety by the Security Council in resolution 827
(1993) of 25 May 1993.

455.    The report and the Statute dealt with the constitutionally
controversial question of the legal basis for the establishment of the
Tribunal, the highly complex substantive legal issues regarding its
competence, and the detailed procedural and organizational aspects of
its work.  The Statute is widely regarded as breaking new ground in the
area of international criminal law.

        F.  Post-conflict peace-building

456.    In "An Agenda for Peace", I stressed that a process of
post-conflict peace-building was essential for preventing the recurrence
of armed conflict between States.  Despite the voluminous and very
useful analysis and commentary which has emerged in the months since
that report appeared, however, little attention has been given to this
concept.  Peace-building encompasses more than the reconstruction of the
peace after the cessation of hostilities.  Peace-building must be linked
to the comprehensive development efforts of the United Nations,
political, economic, social and cultural.

457.    The objective of peace-building is to involve hostile parties in
mutually beneficial undertakings which not only contribute to economic
and social development but also reinforce the confidence necessary for
the creation of lasting peace.  The reduction of hostile perceptions
through educational exchanges and curriculum reform may also be
essential to forestall the re-emergence of cultural and national
tensions which could spark renewed hostilities.  Such an approach can
also play a vital role in building the peace in situations characterized
by civil conflict.

458.    Peace-building begins with practical measures to restore the
civil society, reinvigorate its economy, repair the land and restore its
productivity, repatriate and resettle displaced people and refugees; it
also entails reducing the levels of arms in society, as a component of
the volatility that induces violence.  These steps, taken in the context
of comprehensive humanitarian efforts, are all essential to set the
stage for sustainable social, political and economic development.

        1.  Mine clearance

459.    Of all the tasks involved in setting a nation on a new road to
peace and prosperity, perhaps none has the immediate urgency of mine
clearance.  Tens of millions of mines have been left in areas of
conflict around the world.  Although mine-clearance efforts may last for
decades, the restoration of transport infrastructures, resettlement
areas and agricultural land are often early priorities, and no attempt
to restore a sense of community and security can succeed without
effective land-mine removal.

460.    I have therefore launched a coordinated programme of action for
mine clearance, involving the Department of Humanitarian Affairs, the
Department of Peace-keeping Operations and other competent bodies.  In
Angola, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia, mine clearing is at present
undertaken as part of peace-keeping and humanitarian efforts; a
concerted drive to rid those countries of mine pollution must wait until
the cessation of hostilities.  In countries where major conflict has
ceased or abated, mine clearance is under way and fighters are being
disarmed, demobilized and aided in making the transition to productive
peacetime work.

461.    In Afghanistan, at least 10 million mines were left behind after
the recent war, and are now seriously hindering the restoration of
normal life in many parts of the country.  The Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan is managing a
mine-clearance programme involving the training and supervision of some
2,000 mine clearers fielded under the auspices of Afghan
non-governmental organizations.  If sufficient funding is made available
by donors in a timely manner, it seems likely that the majority of the
high priority cultivable land will be cleared by the end of 1997.

462.    Mine clearance progresses well in Cambodia, where some 1,400
mine clearers are now working.  There are perhaps 5 million mines spread
all over the eastern districts, and clearance is slow, especially in the
flood plains and paddy-fields.  Following the successful use of mine
detecting dogs in Afghanistan, a similar effort is under way in
Cambodia, but it will be many years before this problem is finally
resolved.  It is therefore imperative that mine clearing should continue
in Cambodia after the termination of UNTAC.

463.    A plan has been prepared for the clearance of an estimated 2
million mines in Mozambique.  Funds have been raised, partly from the
ONUMOZ budget and partly through a trust fund administered by UNDP.  A
mine-clearance training facility is to be a major part of the programme,
since there too mine clearance will be a long-term operation.

        2.  Electoral assistance

464.    During the year, I established an Electoral Assistance Unit in
the Department of Political Affairs.  Since the Unit became operational,
it has provided electoral assistance to 36 Member States, including four
cases where the requests were received before 1992 (Angola, Cambodia,
Mali and Western Sahara).  Of those 36 cases, 2 relate to organization
and conduct, 4 to verification, 26 to technical assistance, 9 to
coordination and support and 7 to follow-up and report.  Twelve of those
cases were a combination of technical assistance and one of the other
categories.  Of the Member States requesting assistance, 26 were from
Africa, 4 from Eastern Europe, 4 from Latin America and 1 from Asia.

465.    Member States seek electoral assistance from the United Nations
essentially in four circumstances:  when a country is undergoing a
transition to democracy; when it is seeking to build a peaceful
alternative to conflict; following decolonization; and in
self-determination elections.  In Eritrea and Western Sahara for
example, the United Nations has a long-term commitment to assisting in
the design of the electoral and referendal systems.  The case of Eritrea
is an important illustration of this aspect of the Organization's
activity.

466.    Eritrea suffered more than 25 years of civil war, which ended in
May 1991, and now benefits from overall political and security
stability.  In December 1991, the President of the Transitional
Government of Ethiopia made the necessary arrangements with the
Provisional Government of Eritrea to facilitate United Nations
supervision of a referendum by which the people of Eritrea could
determine their political future.  On 19 May 1992, the Referendum
Commission of Eritrea requested the United Nations to undertake the
verification of the referendum.  A technical team from the Electoral
Assistance Unit visited Eritrea between 30 July and 8 August 1992 to
gather information and submitted a report, on the basis of which I
reported to the General Assembly, seeking a mandate to undertake a
verification mission as requested.  On 16 December 1992, the General
Assembly, in its resolution 47/114, authorized the establishment of the
United Nations Observer Mission to Verify the Referendum in Eritrea
(UNOVER).

467.    On 6 January 1993, I visited Eritrea to make a first-hand
appraisal of the referendum process.  UNOVER was inaugurated on 7
January 1993 and consisted of 21 international staff members supported
by local personnel, headed by my Personal Representative, Samir Sanbar.
They were joined by 85 observers during the referendum, which took place
from 23 to 25 April 1993.  The total budget of UNOVER was in the order
of $2 million.

468.    According to the Eritrean Referendum Commission, more than 98.5
per cent of the nearly 1.2 million registered voters voted in the
referendum.  Voting was overwhelmingly in favour of independence, which
was declared on 27 April 1993.  Soon after, Eritrea was admitted to
membership in the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity.

469.    In 1992, the Department of Humanitarian Affairs launched
consolidated appeals for the region of the Horn of Africa.  For Eritrea,
the amount sought to meet emergency needs was $191 million, towards
which the international community contributed resources in cash and in
kind equivalent to $136 million.  The results of any democratic
electoral process must be supported by a fundamentally healthy society,
economy and State if they are to be durable.  The decades of warfare
damaged or destroyed much of the physical infrastructure in Eritrea and,
together with the drought in recent years, produced major relief needs;
but the need is no longer for massive emergency relief but chiefly for
major post-disaster rehabilitation and development.  In July 1992, the
United Nations and the Provisional Government of Eritrea launched a
three-year programme for refugee reintegration and rehabilitation of
resettlement areas, which requires $262 million and seeks to repatriate
500,000 Eritrean refugees from the Sudan.  So far only $32.4 million has
been pledged.

470.    Not all the interventions of the United Nations in electoral
observation have been large-scale missions such as UNAVEM II, UNTAC or
UNOVER.  Other approaches, involving the coordination and provision of
logistic support to groups of international observers, have been
effective.  Malawi is a particularly interesting case.  Coordination
efforts began three months before the referendum date and included the
deployment of observers during voter registration and the referendum
campaign.  The involvement of the United Nations was not limited to mere
observation, however; on two occasions, I intervened to help secure the
agreement of the parties to a change in the date of the elections and on
the question of ballot boxes.  The referendum confirmed the will of the
Malawian people to move to a multi-party system, and the Government is
now proceeding with the arrangements for parliamentary elections that
will be fully supported by the United Nations.

        G.  Disarmament

471.    Since my report on new dimensions of arms regulation and
disarmament in the post-cold-war era, significant events have taken
place in the international security environment, requiring new responses
and renewed efforts by the international community to deal with them.
The momentum created by the many positive breakthroughs of the past year
must now be maintained.

472.    Most notable among such achievements is the recent decision of
the Conference on Disarmament to give its Ad Hoc Committee on a Nuclear
Test Ban a mandate to negotiate a treaty on a comprehensive nuclear test
ban.  That decision was made possible by the crucial commitment of
nuclear-weapons States to a continuing moratorium on nuclear testing,
and represents a culmination of the efforts of the international
community to bring about progress in one of the most vital areas of
international security.  The year 1993 is the first in which no nuclear
tests have been carried out since the moratoria of the 1960s.

473.    To be viable, a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty should be
universal, verifiable and of indefinite duration.  Coupled with a
renewed interest in the cessation of the production of fissionable
material, a comprehensive nuclear test ban could help to halt the
qualitative arms race and to prevent other countries from acquiring
nuclear weapons.  That would strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation
regime, which has gained in significance as the number of nuclear
weapons is being drastically reduced.  Together, all these developments
offer an incentive to the States parties to the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to extend that Treaty in 1995
unconditionally and indefinitely.

474.    I am gratified by the fact that Belarus has recently ratified
the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and I very much hope that Kazakhstan and
Ukraine will follow that example.  I have expressed my deep concern
about the intention of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to
withdraw from the Treaty, and I am therefore encouraged by the fact that
its Government has postponed a final decision on the matter and is
engaged in negotiations with other interested parties, in particular the
International Atomic Energy Agency.

475.    Global non-proliferation efforts can also be facilitated by the
establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones.  The progress made towards
the full entry into force of the Treaty of Tlatelolco is most welcome;
in this context, regional initiatives such as those taken by Argentina
and Brazil are commendable.  I am also gratified by the advances made in
the implementation of the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa.
I extend my strongest support to the ongoing efforts to finalize the
text of the treaty to establish formally a nuclear-weapon-free zone in
that region.

476.    Another significant landmark in the prevention of the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is the signature of the
Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production,
Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction by some
148 States.  The smooth establishment of the Preparatory Commission for
the Organization on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons augurs well for
the effective and successful implementation of the Convention.  Every
effort must now be made to achieve universality at the earliest date.

477.    The establishment of the Register of Conventional Arms is
another event of historic significance.  In the current situation, where
emphasis is placed on building confidence through increased openness and
transparency in military matters, the Register has a unique potential.
I am pleased that all major arms suppliers and recipient States have
provided information to the Register in its first year of operation.
The Register has proved to be a success.

478.    The importance of the Register becomes even clearer as we relate
it to the question of excessive and destabilizing capabilities in
conventional weapons.  Although no substitute for actual arms
reductions, the Register could help to make military behaviour more
predictable and to reassure neighbouring States of each other's
non-belligerent intentions.  It could be particularly helpful in regions
and subregions where there are potential hostilities, as it could lead
to gradual reductions in armaments, while allowing the legitimate
defence concerns of the parties involved to be considered.  I would
therefore strongly urge Member States to make use of the Register,
together with other measures of confidence-building, particularly within
regional and subregional frameworks.  This is one way in which
disarmament and arms control can contribute to the Organization's
efforts in the fields of preventive diplomacy and peacemaking, and I
have decided that this should become a priority task for the Office of
Disarmament Affairs in the Department of Political Affairs.

479.    An issue closely related to non-proliferation efforts, and to
which I attach great importance, is that of the transfer of dual-purpose
technology.  While it is essential for the international community to
prevent the misuse of technology for military purposes, it would be
unfair to obstruct legitimate development opportunities.  To ensure that
all countries, particularly developing countries, will enjoy the
peaceful uses of science and technology, I call on the international
community to seek agreement on control arrangements that will be
universal and non-discriminatory.

        H.  The humanitarian imperative

        1.  Towards a coordinated United Nations response

480.    The international community has asked that more be done to
strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to provide humanitarian
assistance, through coordinated planning and implementation involving
the Departments of Political Affairs, Peace-keeping Operations and
Humanitarian Affairs, and that humanitarian concerns should be reflected
in fact-finding missions and in peace-keeping operations.  I have
therefore taken steps to ensure that essential collaboration takes place
among those Departments and between them and all other United Nations
organizations and bodies.

481.    Humanitarian emergencies, by causing the mass exodus of people,
may constitute threats to international peace and security, or aggravate
existing threats; conversely, disturbances of the peace may give rise to
humanitarian crises.  I stress again that it is essential that the
United Nations should develop the ability to link humanitarian action
and protection of human rights with peacemaking, peace-keeping and
peace-building.  In formulating the response to humanitarian
emergencies, we cannot ignore the infrastructural requirements of the
societies in need.  Rehabilitation and reconstruction must accompany
emergency relief.

482.    Because relief personnel frequently operate in areas of conflict
or danger even prior to the deployment of United Nations forces, their
security is of particular concern.  The murder of United Nations staff
members working in humanitarian programmes in Afghanistan and the Sudan
this past year is a tragic reminder of the fragile status of the United
Nations humanitarian presence in turbulent areas (see figure 12).  Every
effort is being made to ensure the safety of United Nations personnel,
and I am also concerned about the security of the personnel of
humanitarian non-governmental organizations who are assisting in the
implementation of United Nations relief programmes.  It is imperative
that Governments and other parties to conflict respect their obligations
under international law to ensure the secure access of relief personnel
and supplies to the victims of humanitarian emergencies.

483.    The United Nations system has continued to adapt, refine and
strengthen its mechanisms to address new challenges.  United Nations and
other organizations, including non-governmental organizations, have had
to increase their emergency humanitarian relief substantially, straining
resources available for reconstruction and development efforts.  The
three principal United Nations organizations engaged in humanitarian
assistance, UNICEF, WFP and UNHCR, increased their relief outlays from
$278 million in 1989 to $1,287 million during 1992.

484.    At the last meeting of the Administrative Committee on
Coordination, I discussed extensively with the heads of organizations,
funds and programmes the issues of coordination and effectiveness of
United Nations humanitarian action.  While many issues remain to be
resolved, I believe that the organizations of the United Nations system
are moving in the right direction to establish mechanisms for greater
coherence and increased rapidity in their response.  One idea which I
have encouraged relates to the immediate deployment, at the start of a
crisis, of United Nations humanitarian emergency teams, which would draw
on the capacities and expertise of the organizations of the system.

485.    There is an Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), composed of
executive heads of organizations and chaired by the
Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, which sets the
direction on policy and coordination questions that shape the
humanitarian response of the system.  Arrangements have had to be made,
however, to deal with issues that do not fall within the existing
mandates of IASC member organizations, for example the issue of
internally displaced persons, whose numbers are growing at an alarming
rate.  Operational responsibility for programmes benefiting the
internally displaced have been determined on the basis of the capacities
of the organizations in the field.  UNHCR, UNDP, UNICEF and WFP have all
been addressing the various aspects of this problem.

486.    As an integral part of the new arrangements for the prompt
coordination of the international humanitarian response, the $50 million
Central Emergency Revolving Fund has proved to be a useful instrument.
Since its inception, $54 million have been advanced from the Fund to
finance urgent humanitarian action in Afghanistan, Georgia, Iraq, Kenya,
Lebanon, Mozambique, Somalia, Tajikistan and the former Yugoslavia; $20
million of the advances have been reimbursed, confirming the Fund's
viability.  I am at present considering how the scope and operations of
the Fund could be broadened.  Given the magnitude and range of emergency
humanitarian crises, it may also be useful to consider expanding its
resources.

487.    Thus far in 1993, the new coordination arrangements under the
Department of Humanitarian Affairs, have helped launch 17 inter-agency
consolidated appeals for over $4 billion for relief and rehabilitation
programmes in some 20 countries, involving assistance to more than 20
million affected people.  Only a quarter of the resources appealed for
were forthcoming, however, which has considerably hampered the effective
implementation of humanitarian programmes.  I have asked the
Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs to suggest ways in
which international community support for those programmes could be
further strengthened.

488.    In northern Iraq, United Nations humanitarian efforts prevented
another serious refugee crisis.  For the Somalis, the spectre of
starvation and disease has receded, and in Mozambique, too, the
humanitarian situation seems hopeful.  But in many other situations - in
Afghanistan, Angola, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Liberia and southern Sudan
- human suffering continues to increase, and for many millions of
refugees and displaced persons the situation remains desperate.

        2.  Disaster relief and mitigation

489.    Apart from tragedies and crises caused by man's inhumanity to
man, natural calamities, such as cyclones, drought, floods, earthquakes
and volcanic eruptions, continue to take a heavy toll of human life and
property.  Indeed, the rapidly increasing rate of urbanization, and the
steady increase in world population, mean that natural disasters are
both more destructive and more costly than ever before.  In 1991,
natural disasters took more than 162,000 lives and caused damage to
property estimated at $44 billion.  Disaster mitigation, which should
involve both preventive and preparedness measures, can effectively
reduce the human toll and economic losses.  Ensuring a more effective
disaster management response system is yet one more challenge for the
United Nations system and the international community.

490.    From January 1992 to June 1993, the Department of Humanitarian
Affairs coordinated the international response to more than 90 natural
disasters, including earthquakes or floods in Egypt, Turkey, Indonesia,
Kazakhstan and Pakistan.  Coordination mechanisms such as search and
rescue teams and on-site coordination of relief activities have been
strengthened.  The ultimate objective is to increase national and local
capacities to deal with disasters.  Efforts to prevent and mitigate
disasters must begin at the grass-roots level if they are to be
effective in minimizing the harm caused by natural disasters.

491.    I am convinced that improved disaster management, especially
through enhanced preventive action, benefiting from scientific and
technological advances, can help to reduce substantially the impact of
natural disasters and alleviate the sufferings of the victims.  Indeed,
the Scientific and Technical Committee on the International Decade for
Natural Disaster Reduction, consisting of scientists and specialists
from related disciplines, recommended holding a conference where their
expertise could be transferred to policy makers in disaster-prone
countries.  The General Assembly endorsed that recommendation at its
forty-sixth session, and I am confident that the World Conference on
Natural Disaster Reduction will mobilize the more active involvement of
international and national organizations in prevention, preparedness and
mitigation activities.  I look forward to the participation of all
Member States in that Conference.

        3.  Relief operations

(a)     The Sudan

492.    The humanitarian situation caused by continuing conflict in
southern Sudan is a matter of considerable concern.  While much was done
to ameliorate human suffering, the underlying problems remain, and
require greater humanitarian efforts.

493.    A series of high-level initiatives have been taken to broaden
and accelerate the delivery of relief assistance to conflict-affected
areas.  During a visit to the Sudan in September 1992 by the
Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, agreement was reached
with the Government on the principle of access to all people in need of
assistance, and on specific air and river corridors for relief
deliveries.  Following "proximity talks" between the Government and
three factions of the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement, conducted
by the United Nations at Nairobi in December 1992, further agreements
were reached on road, river and rail corridors, and on updated
assessments of the location and condition of displaced populations.  In
January 1993, the United Nations sponsored talks between the Government
and international non-governmental organizations which resulted in
wide-ranging agreements designed to enhance the effectiveness of relief
operations conducted by those organizations.

494.    Despite various efforts, including those of Operation Lifeline
Sudan, the humanitarian situation of the affected population remains
precarious.  I consequently appointed Vieri Traxler as Special Envoy for
Humanitarian Affairs for the Sudan, to travel to the region to develop
practical and verifiable measures to mitigate the human suffering in
several parts of the country.  The Government of the Sudan at first
denied Mr. Traxler's mission access to the country but, after further
contact, it has been accepted.

(b)     Kenya

495.    Early in 1993, Kenya faced major humanitarian challenges.  They
included requirements for drought relief and drought recovery, such as
seeds, tools and veterinary aid, and assistance for refugees in Kenya,
primarily from Somalia.  It was also necessary to promote stability on
both sides of the borders with Ethiopia and Somalia, and to help create
the conditions for the return of refugees from Kenya to those countries.
The Department of Humanitarian Affairs took the lead in coordinating the
preparation of a consolidated inter-agency appeal for Kenya for a total
of $192 million.  As at 31 July, the nine United Nations organizations
requesting funds had received $74.5 million, or 39 per cent of the
amount requested.

496.    It is clear that Kenya will continue to require substantial
humanitarian assistance throughout the remainder of 1993 and in 1994,
and that a consolidated inter-agency appeal will be necessary for 1994.
Current crop assessments indicate the likelihood of a third consecutive
year of lower than normal harvests, primarily because of drought.  UNHCR
is preparing an appeal for the repatriation of refugees to Somalia from
Kenya, a process which will extend well into 1994, as will the need for
continued cross-border operations.  Finally, special assistance efforts
are now being considered to help Kenyans who have been internally
displaced by violence in parts of the Rift Valley, Nyanza and Western
provinces.

(c)     Ethiopia

497.    There continue to be significant relief needs in Ethiopia, but
the overall emphasis has moved to rehabilitation efforts.  In the course
of 1993, the United Nations concentrated largely on providing
humanitarian assistance to about 5 million people, mainly victims of
drought, former soldiers and their families, several hundred thousand
refugees from Somalia, returnees, and persons internally displaced.
These numbers include an unabated influx of Sudanese refugees, as well
as Kenyan and Djiboutian refugees and 400,000 to 500,000 Ethiopians who
have returned over the past three years but who still have complex
relief needs.

498.    An especially noteworthy feature of the case of Ethiopia is the
cross-mandate approach, under which those in need are assisted by
competent United Nations organizations, the Government and others in a
unified programme, regardless of their status (for example, returning
refugees or internally displaced persons); the Emergency Preparation and
Planning Group plays an important coordination role.

499.    The consolidated inter-agency appeal for Ethiopia, launched in
January 1993, sought $299.9 million to support such efforts.  As at 31
July, $109.7 million had been received in donor contributions, or 36.6
per cent of the funds requested.

(d)     Drought emergency in southern Africa

500.    The drought emergency in southern Africa programme provides an
example of the way in which the United Nations, in cooperation with
Governments, regional organizations, international financial
institutions and non-governmental organizations can meet the challenges
of the humanitarian tasks that lie ahead.  When 18 million lives were
placed at risk by the worst drought to affect southern Africa in this
century, that programme, a coordinated approach between the United
Nations and a regional institution, the Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC), was established as the cornerstone of a complex relief
strategy involving assistance channelled through multilateral, bilateral
and non-governmental organizations.  Funding requirements amount to $858
million.

501.    Tragedy was averted because the international community
responded positively to the plight of southern Africa, and the
Governments of the region made extraordinary efforts to mobilize large
amounts of their own resources for food imports and the distribution of
emergency aid.  Although the unprecedented quantities of food aid they
received placed a severe strain on the logistics capacity of individual
countries, six of which are land-locked, the region demonstrated its
capacity to deliver relief assistance to affected populations in a
timely fashion.

502.    The World Food Programme/SADC Logistics Advisory Centre was one
of the collaborative mechanisms critical to the programme's success; it
ensured well-coordinated utilization of ports and land and rail
corridors.  The Department of Humanitarian Affairs continues its
collaboration with SADC to ensure that the emergency management capacity
established under the programme is sustained.  Of all the natural
disasters affecting Africa, drought imposes the greatest toll in human
suffering and economic costs.

(e)     Chernobyl

503.    Seven years have passed since the accident occurred at the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant.  I visited Ukraine recently and was
greatly moved to see the continuing consequences of that disaster in the
daily life of the population.  Some sections of the populations of
Belarus and the Russian Federation have also been affected.

504.    My Coordinator of International Cooperation for Chernobyl has
also visited the three affected States, including the exclusion zone
around the encased reactor.  After extensive consultations, a new
approach has been formulated for the activities of the United Nations
system in response to the Chernobyl accident, involving mitigation of
its consequences through the implementation of specific projects to
address priority needs in the affected areas.  To be effective and
credible, however, such activities require adequate funding, and thus
depend on an appropriate response from the international donor
community.

        4.  Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees

505.    The world's refugee population now stands at a staggering 19
million, and the number of internally displaced persons is 25 million.
Such is the magnitude of the problem the world faces in 1993.  This is a
particularly difficult challenge, and the human and material resources
of the United Nations system have been stretched to the limit.

506.    The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
is carrying out a three-track strategy of prevention, preparedness and
solutions.  While responding to refugee situations in countries of
asylum, the Office also turned its attention to countries of origin,
seeking to prevent and contain refugee movements.  UNHCR provided
assistance not only to refugees, returnees and displaced persons but
also, in the case of the former Yugoslavia, to people affected by
conflict or under a direct threat of expulsion, or subjected to the form
of persecution now known as "ethnic cleansing".  Invoking the human
right to remain in one's country of origin, the Office of the High
Commissioner sought to ensure that people were not forced to flee from
their homes in the first place.

507.    One of the highest priorities of UNHCR is to secure the
protection of vulnerable groups in areas where peace-keeping operations
have brought about a halt in military hostilities.  UNHCR has given
special attention to sexual violence against refugee women.  Among the
most odious practices to re-emerge on a large scale in recent conflicts
is the use of rape and other forms of sexual violence as an instrument
of systematic persecution and intimidation.  UNHCR is attempting to
achieve international consensus on concrete measures to prevent such
practices.

508.    UNHCR has also focused on refugee children.  Persistent
protection problems include military recruitment, detention, irregular
adoption, denial of the right to education, and the situation of
unaccompanied minors in the care of families not their own.  The
guidelines and considerations contained in the pamphlet entitled
Evacuation of Children from Conflict Areas, published jointly by UNHCR
and UNICEF in December 1992, illustrate the great potential for
inter-agency cooperation in securing the protection of children's rights
in the most difficult situations.

509.    Among the most notable refugee problems of the past year, the
situation in Afghanistan stands out.  The end of the occupation by
forces of the former Soviet Union, and the return of large parts of the
country to relative stability, have made possible the return of large
numbers of refugees from safe havens in Pakistan and elsewhere.
Although continuing hostilities in parts of the country have deterred
some refugees from returning, it is estimated that some 1.7 million
Afghans have re-entered Afghanistan in the course of the past 18 months.
The provision of assistance to those returnees is an important element
in the emergency programmes being coordinated by the Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan.

        Charter of the United Nations, Article 1, paragraph 3

        V.  CONCLUSION:  STRENGTHENING THE HUMAN FOUNDATION

510.    This report has addressed an immense array of practical and
urgent programmes and measures designed to carry forward the purposes
and principles of the Charter.  Underlying these practical efforts are
broader endeavours which warrant our commitment over the long term so
that we may construct a more enduringly just and advancing global
society.

511.    A year ago, I stated that a new opportunity had presented
itself, that fulfilment of the Charter's original promise was once again
achievable.  That opportunity has been grasped.  Responsibilities have
been heaped upon the United Nations.  The new activism has made it
clear, however, that new levels of political will and intellectual
creativity must be attained if wider engagement is to produce enduring
achievement.

512.    The events of the past 12 months should impress upon us the need
for a new realism.  The United Nations, by undertaking a range of
problems as wide as the globe itself, must be expected to achieve
successes but also to experience failure.  The failures cannot be put to
one side; they require continuing commitment.  And successes cannot be
regarded as permanent; every positive outcome is likely to be a
starting-point for further effort.  In a spirit of realism and new
possibility, a synthesis of heretofore opposing concepts is conceivable:
the United Nations as the instrument of the body of Member States, and
the United Nations as more than the sum of its parts.

513.    Only international action that emerges from the crucible of
debate and decision in the General Assembly, the Security Council and
the other organs of the United Nations carries with it the full
authority of the world community.  The United Nations is now understood
to be humanity's best hope in the pursuit of peace, development and
human rights.

514.    Dedicated to the integrity and development of each individual,
drawing legitimacy from all peoples, expressing the consensus of States,
the United Nations Organization calls forth, through its universality
and dedication to life's basic tasks, a greater potential than humanity
has ever before conceived possible.
