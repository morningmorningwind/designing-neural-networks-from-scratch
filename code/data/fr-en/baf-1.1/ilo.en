with its usual procedure, it could only take account, in its examination
of the case, of communications transmitted by the complainant organisation
and of those submitted by, or through, the government concerned.   It accordingly
decided to inform the New Zealand Federation of Labour that its comments
can only be taken into account if they are transmitted by, or through,
the Government.   Since the Government's reply to the complaint has already
been received, the Committee decided to examine this case at its next meeting.

URGENT APPEALS

	8.	The Committee observes that, in spite of the time which has elapsed
since the last examination of the following cases and the seriousness of
the allegations in some of them, the observations or information requested
of the governments concerned have not been received:  Cases Nos. 1190 and 1199
(Peru), 1296 (Antigua and Barbuda), 1300 (Costa Rica), 1308 (Grenada),
1311 (Guatemala), 1313 (Brazil) and 1325 (Sudan).   The Committee draws
the attention of the governments concerned to the fact that, in conformity
with the procedural rules set out in paragraph 17 of the Committee's 127th Report,
approved by the Governing Body, it may present a report at its next meeting
on the substance of these cases even if the governments' observations have
not been received in time for that meeting.   The Committee accordingly
requests the governments concerned to transmit their observations or information
as a matter of urgency.

*
*   *

	9.	The Committee draws the legislative aspects of the following cases
to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions
and Recommendations: Cases Nos. 997, 999 and 1029 (Turkey); 1040 (Central
African Republic);  1098, 1132, 1254, 1257, 1290, 1299 and 1316 (Uruguay);
1266 (Burkina Faso);  1291 (Colombia);  1293 (Dominican Republic);  1323
(Philippines);  1330 (Guyana).

Direct contacts

	10. 	As regards the cases relating to El Salvador (Cases Nos. 953, 973,
1150, 1168, 1233, 1258, 1269, 1273 and 1281), the Committee at its May 1985
meeting noted that, following an official visit by the Director-General
to the country, the Government was willing to accept a direct contacts
mission with a view to examining the various aspects of these cases.
Not having received confirmation from the Government to enable this mission
to take place, the Committee urges the Government to reply as rapidly as
possible so that the Committee will have before it, at its February 1986
meeting, information obtained on the spot on these cases.

	11.	As regards the cases relating to Honduras (Cases Nos. 1216 and 1271),
a Government representative during the 71st Session of the Interntional
Labour Conference (June 1985) agreed that a direct contacts mission take
place with a view to overcoming the divergences existing between Conventions
Nos. 87 and 98 and Honduran legislation, as well as to obtain information
on, and to discuss, the above cases.   Since the Committee has not received
confirmation from the
Government to enable this mission to take place,
it urges the Government of Honduras to reply as rapidly as possible so
that the Committee will have before it, at its February 1986 meeting, information
obtained on the spot concerning these cases.

Effect given to the recommendations of the
Committee and of the Governing Body

	12.	As regards Case No. 1074 (USA), examined by the Committee at its November
1981 meeting, information was requested from the Government on the results
of the pending appeals lodged by dismissed air traffic controllers.   In
a communication dated 23 August 1985, the Government states that, as at
1 August 1985, the Full Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) has sustained
the dismissal in 4,659 cases and ordered reinstatement in 94 cases;  in
70 cases the appeal was withdrawn and the remaining 239 appeals before
that instance are pending.   At the US Court of Appeals level, despite
a decision in favour of the employer in ten lead cases, 2,690 controllers
renewed their appeals, 289 of which were subsequently withdrawn voluntarily
by the appellants and 27 of which were dismissed by the Court.   In 104
of these appeals, the Court has reaffirmed the dismissal.   Thus, 2,270
of those cases are still pending.   As this is the sixth communication
from the Government concerning the status of the appeals, the Committee
observes that it would now appear from all the information submitted that,
of the 11,065 dismissed controllers who initially lodged appeals, a total
of 444 reinstatements have been ordered.   The Committee notes the information
supplied by the Government and requests it to continue to inform it of
the outcome of the pending appeals.

	13.	As regards Case No. 1100 (India), the Committee had requested the
Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the case pending before
the Supreme Court concerning the amendments introduced to the General Insurance
Business (Nationalisation) Act which allegedly modify the conditions of
service of the employees in the insurance sector without the consent of
the unions concerned.   In a communication of 9 July 1985, the Government
states that the Supreme Court quashed the scheme of 1980 and left the option
of amendment of the Act to the Government.   The President of India promulgated,
on 17 September 1984, an ordinance amending the General Insurance Business
(Nationalisation) Act, 1972.   This ordinance was challenged in the Supreme
Court by the employees of the General Insurance Corporation.   In the meantime,
the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Bill was introduced
and passed by both Houses of Parliament.   This Act has also been challenged
in the Supreme Court.   The matter is, therefore,
sub judice
.   The Committee
takes note of this information and that the Government will communicate
further developments regarding this case.

	14.	As regards the case concerning Chile (Case No. 1191), the Government
states in a communication dated 14 August 1985 that the Second Chamber
of the Supreme Court granted the appeal lodged in this case and overturned
the decision to stay proceedings which had been handed down by the Military
Court and the courts martial in complaints relating to allegations of torture
and ill-treatment of trade union leaders.   The Committee takes note of
this information and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments
in this matter.

	15.	As regards the case concerning Peru (Case No. 1228), the Committee
had requested the Government to carry out an investigation into the alleged
confiscation of mail addressed abroad by the Union of Peruvian Educational
Workers and to inform it of the outcome of this inquiry.   In a communication
dated 15 July 1985, the Government states that, since 1980 when the democratic
regime was instituted, all forms of control of mail have been eliminated;
thus there is not, nor could there be, any supposed confiscation of mail
in any circumstances.   The Committee takes note of this reply.

	16.	As regards Case No. 1241 (Australia), examined by the Committee at
its May 1984 meeting, information was requested from the Government on
any measures taken to grant facilities to the Northern Territory Public
Service Association, such as access to its members and distribution of
trade union literature at the workplace.   In a communication dated 20
August 1985, the Government states that, on 8 October 1984, the Northern
Territory Public Service Commissioner circulated an instruction to all
Departmental Heads and Prescribed Authorities indicating that the union
in question be granted the same rights of access to its members and the
use of notice boards as is accorded other registered unions.   The Committee
takes note of this information with interest.

	17.	As regards the case concerning Chile (Case No. 1297) which the Committee
examined at its May 1985 meeting, it regretted that the Government had
not supplied more detailed information on the persons who, according to
the complainants, had been exiled for their trade union functions or activities
and informed both the Government and the complainants that it would appreciate
receiving any additional information available in this respect.   In a
communication dated 12 August 1985, the Government states that for humanitarian
reasons it has authorised the return to the country of Héctor Cuevas Salvador.
The Committee takes note of this information with interest and urges
the Government to continue to keep it informed of any similar measure taken
in favour of those persons still in exile.

	18.	Lastly, as regards Sri Lanka (Cases Nos. 988/1003), Morocco (Case
No. 1077), Pakistan (Case No. 1175), India (Case No. 1227) and the United Kingdom
(Case No. 1261), the Committee again requests the governments concerned
to keep it informed of developments in these cases.   The Committee hopes
that these governments will communicate this information at an early date.

*
*   *

	19.	In addition, the Committee notes with concern that, despite the time
which has elapsed since the Governing Body requested certain governments
to keep it informed of measures taken to give effect to its recommendations,
these governments' replies have not been received.   In this respect, the
Committee would point out that, in accordance with the procedural rules
set out in paragraphs 27 and 28 of its 127th Report, approved by the Governing
Body, if there is no reply or if the reply given is partly or entirely
unsatisfactory, the matter should be followed up periodically through invitations
to the Director-General at suitable intervals, according to the nature
of each case, to remind the government concerned of the matter and to request
it to supply information as to the action taken on the recommendations
approved by the Governing Body.   The Committee itself will, from time
to time, report on the situation.

	20.	In these circumstances, the Committee recalls those requests made
some time ago and which remain without response.   At its November 1984
meeting, the Committee invited the Government of Ecuador (Case No. 1230)
to inform it of the outcome of the trial before the Second Criminal Court
of Chimborazo concerning the circumstances surrounding the death, on 17 June 1983,
of two Culluctuc trade unionists, Mr. Pedro Cuji and Mrs. Felipa Pucha,
and the wounding of three peasants who were members of the Culluctuc Indigenous
Community.   At its November 1984 meeting, it also requested the Government
of Barbados (Case No. 1264) to keep it informed of the outcome of the measures
taken by the Chief Labour Officer towards recognition of the National Union
of Public Workers for the purposes of collective bargaining.   Lastly,
at its May 1984 meeting, the Committee expressed its serious concern in
the case of Honduras (Case No. 1268) at the lack of information on the
circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the trade union leader,
Rolando Vindel González, and requested the Government to keep it informed
of the outcome of the court inquiries underway.   Not having received the
replies and information requested from the governments on these various
points, the Committee invites the Director-General to bring these matters
to the attention of the governments concerned and request them to send
their replies urgently so as to enable the Committee, at its next meeting,
to make a further assessment of the situation in each case.

*
*   *

	21.	With regard to Cases Nos. 1135 (Ghana), 1146 (Iraq) and 1237 (Brazil),
the Committee regrets that, despite repeated appeals, the respective governments
have not replied to the Committee's requests to be kept informed of developments
in the various cases.   The Committee wishes to recall that:

In
Case No. 1135 (Ghana)
, it had requested the Government to inform it
of any measures which might be taken to terminate the freeze on the bank
accounts of the trade unionists who were in exile.   In this respect the
Committee repeats its conclusion that, if, following investigation, no
evidence is found to prove
any misappropriation of trade union funds, it
would be unreasonable to continue the freeze of the unionists' accounts
whether they are in the country or not;
In
Case No. 1146 (Iraq)
, the Committee requested the Government to send
it the text of the judgement sentencing to death the leaders of the General
Federation of Trade Unions in Iraq, Messrs. Mohamed Ayesh and Baden Fadel,
who, according to the Government, had ceased to be union leaders well before
being tried and sentenced to death for espionage and conspiracy against
the security of the State.   The Committee once again expresses its regret
that the Government has not transmitted the text of the judgement handed
down in this matter;

In
Case No. 1237 (Brazil)
, the Committee requested the Government to communicate
a copy of the judgements, together with the reasons adduced therefor, handed
down against those responsible for the death of the trade union leader,
Margarita Maria Alves, in August 1983.   In this respect the Committee
would once again recall that trade union rights can only be exercised in
a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against
trade unionists, and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle
is respected.

	22.	The Committee expresses the firm hope that in all these cases the
governments concerned will take the necessary measures to give full effect
to the recommendations of the Committee and the Governing Body.

IRRECEIVABLE COMPLAINT

	23.	By a communication dated 28 June 1985 the Staff Union of the European
Patent Organisation presented a complaint of alleged violation of trade
union rights against that organisation.   By virtue of the procedure in
force, the Committee can only examine complaints presented against States.
The Committee, accordingly, recommends the Governing Body to decide that
the complaint in question is irreceivable.

CASES NOT CALLING FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION

Case No. 1305

COMPLAINT PRESENTED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT
OF COSTA RICA

	24.	The Committee examined this case at its May 1985 Session and submitted
an interim report to the Governing Body [see 239th Report of the Committee,
paras. 276-297, approved by the Governing Body at its 230th Session (May-June
1985)].

	25.	Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection
of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) and the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
Previous examination of the case

	26.	In this case the complainant organisation had alleged that, as a result
of an appeal lodged with the administrative authorities on 30 August 1984
by one of the candidates not elected to the new national executive committee
of the National Association of Public Employees (ANEP), the Ministry of
Labour and Social Security took measures which resulted in the suspension
of the registration of the election results until a decision had been taken
on the objection, the freezing of the ANEP's bank accounts and retention
of the check-off funds amounting to administrative suspension of the ANEP.

	27.	The Government stated that its decision to investigate the validity
of the elections was legally based on the Ministry of Labour's obligation
to ensure that the unions operated in conformity with the provisions of
the Labour Code concerning democratic voting procedures.   The Government
also stated that the decision to carry out an investigation arose out of
a complaint by a candidate in the elections that there had been irregularities
in the election procedures which justified their annulment.

	28.	The Committee formulated, in particular, the following recommendations
[see 239th Report, para. 297]:

The Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that in
cases where the results of trade union elections are challenged such questions
should be referred to the judicial authorities in order to guarantee an
impartial and objective procedure which should also be expeditious.
The Committee requests the Government to supply full and detailed information
on the results of the inquiries that have been undertaken and to indicate
whether any procedure exists for application to the courts concerning any
administrative decision that may be taken in the matter.

In order to avoid the danger of serious limitations on the right of workers
to elect their representatives in full freedom, cases involving a challenge
to the results of trade union elections should not - pending the final
outcome of the proceedings - have the effect of paralysing the operations
of trade unions.

The Committee hopes that the measures taken by the Government will be lifted
and that the workers' representatives who won the ANEP elections in August
1984 will be authorised to fulfil their duties in full freedom until a
decision on the validity of the elections is reached and that, if necessary,
an appeal may be made to the courts for a final decision in the matter.

B.
The Government's reply

	29.	The Government transmits, as an annex to its communication of 3 July
1985, the text of judgement No. 155 of the First Chamber of the Supreme
Court of Justice, dated 19 December 1984, dealing with an application for
amparo
(enforcement of constitutional rights) lodged by the General Secretary
of the ANEP.   In this judgement, it is decided, in particular, that the
following shall be without effect:  the administrative procedure suspending
the registration of the executive committee of the ANEP, the retention
of cheques representing members' dues and the non-payment of cheques drawn
on the various current bank accounts.

	30.	The preambular part of judgement No. 155 states in particular the
following:

The Ministry of Labour suspended the functioning of the National Association
of Public Employees by refusing to register the new composition of the
national executive committee and thus, to certify the legal capacity of
the body and also by ordering administrative establishments and public
corporations to retain the dues of the Association's members.   It took
those measures pending the outcome of an appeal lodged by one of the Association's
members against the assembly that elected the members of the governing
board.   The case is therefore one of suspension of trade union activities
by administrative order.   This suspension violates freedom of association
because it obstructs or prevents, albeit provisionally, the free functioning
of the Association and restricts the right of association.   The Ministry
was empowered only to verify compliance with the legal requirements that
the documentation must satisfy (a rule implied
in section 344 of the Labour
Code), for any questions that may arise between the members concerning
anomalies in the assembly which do not appear in the record must be settled
by the members before the labour courts.   There is certainly no specific
rule to that effect, but suspension of the registration of the governing
board on grounds unconnected with the formalities of the documentation
itself amounts to depriving the trade union of its legal existence pending
an administrative ruling in a dispute which is of a judicial nature since
the union cannot function without its executive organ (section 347, ibid).
The foregoing criterion does not conflict with the provisions of section
337 already mentioned and section 47 of the Ministry of Labour Organisation
Act because, although it is the Ministry's duty to watch over social organisations
in order to ensure that they function strictly in accordance with the law,
this does not imply freedom to take measures which prevent the normal activity
of the body.   Consequently, the measures referred to above are in breach
of sections 10, 50, 11 and 153 of the Political Constitution.

	31.	The Government states that, after a delivery of judgement No. 155
dealing with the application for
amparo
lodged by the National Association
of Public Employees, the Department of Social Organisations of the Ministry
of Labour and Social Security proceeded to leave without effect the administrative
procedure which had been started, to register the new governing board of
the ANEP, to cancel the communications ordering retention of the check-off
funds which had been sent out in virtue of the procedure started, to extend
the approprate certification of the legal capacity of the ANEP and to inform
those who had challenged the elections that their petition must be lodged
through the judicial channel.

	32.	The Government adds that, on the basis of judgement No. 155, the Department
of Social Organisations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has
rejected every application made to it for the purpose of challenging the
results of trade union elections, indicating that representations on such
matters must be examined through the judicial channel.   Similarly, the
practice followed by the Department of Social Organisations since the delivery
of the aforementioned judgement has been to register the appointment of
new executive committees as it occurs, without awaiting the outcome of
any judicial proceedings challenging such appointments.   The result is
that the functioning of a trade union organisation whose executive committee
is challenged is at no time paralysed by administrative order.

C.
The Committee's conclusions

	33.	The Committee observes with interest that judgement No. 155 of the
First Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, dated 19
December 1984,
expresses principles consistent with those enunciated by the Committee
at its last session, objecting to the measures of administrative suspension
of the ANEP, the freezing of the ANEP's bank accounts and the retention
of check-off funds, which had been taken on the basis of an administrative
appeal lodged by a defeated candidate for election to the new executive
committee of the ANEP.

	34.	The Committee observes in this connection that, as a result of judgement
No. 155, the Department of Social Organisations of the Ministry of Labour
and Social Security registered the new ANEP executive committee which had
been elected, cancelled the communications sent out ordering retention
of the check-off funds, and extended the appropriate certification of the
legal capacity of the ANEP.   Furthermore, in accordance with judgement
No. 155 and with the principle advanced by the Committee at its last session,
the Department of Social Organisations informed those who had challenged
the elections through the administrative channel that any complaint on
that subject must be made through the judicial channel.

	35.	In these circumstances, having regard to the measures adopted by the
administrative authorities as described above, the Committee considers
that this case does not call for further examination.

The Committee's recommendation

	36.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to decide that this case does not call for further examination.

Case No. 1336

COMPLAINT PRESENTED BY THE FEDERATION OF PROGRESSIVE UNIONS
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF MAURITIUS

	37.	The Federation of Progressive Unions (FPU) presented a complaint of
violations of trade union rights in a communication of 7 May 1985 and further
information in a letter of 24 May 1985.   The Government replied in communications
dated 10 June and 14 October 1985.

	38.	Mauritius has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of
the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87);  it has not ratified the
Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
The complainant's allegations

	39.	In its letter of 7 May 1985, the FPU complains of a government decision
to prevent it celebrating May Day.   It alleges that the Commissioner of
Police decided to ban the union's public meeting and cultural gathering
to be held in a village in the south of the country for no apparent reason.
A copy of the Commissioner's notice of refusal addressed to a body called
the "Organisation Southern Unity" is supplied;  no reason for the refusal
appears in the notice.   From a newspaper clipping attached to the complaint,
it appears that the FPU and the "Organisation Southern Unity" had intended
to organise the festivities jointly.

	40.	In its letter of 24 May 1985, the FPU alleges that on 17 May 1985,
following an incident in an export processing zone factory in which two
female workers were assaulted by the factory manager, all the workers in
that factory decided to stop work;  some 20 other factories in the zone,
whose employees are covered by the same union, decided to strike in solidarity.
According to the FPU, upon the intervention of the police and the army,
the President of the union concerned and three other workers were arrested.
Two of the workers have since been released.   The FPU states that the
Government has supported the employers by agreeing to withdraw recognition
of the union in all the factories affected by the strike and is studying
the cancellation of the check-off system.   The complainant points out
that the assault of the two female workers was reported to the police but
has not been followed up.

B.
The Government's reply

	41.	In its communication of 10 June 1985, the Government states that the
strike in one export processing zone factory on 16 May and the solidarity
strike of the following day were unlawful because the procedures prescribed
by law had not been complied with.   Moreover, the workers' representatives
had seen the Minister of Labour the day before with various complaints
about employment conditions and had been assured of immediate action.
The strike was called off on 18 May.

	42.	The Government stresses that police presence at the factories during
the strike was purely to ensure the preservation of law and order;  workers
assembled in one place became riotous, stoned factories and injured two
police officers with stones.   Three persons were arrested for throwing
stones and others were arrested to aid in police inquiries into their contravention
of the law of the land;  the latter have been released on bail after completion
of the inquiry.

	43.	The Government denies that the employers have asked for the cancellation
of the registration of the unions concerned in the
strike.   It states
that some 30 workers have been suspended from their employment pending
disciplinary hearings at the end of May and some others have not been allowed
to resume work, both actions being legal since the workers had breached
their employment contracts by participating in an unlawful strike.   The
Government adds that it has pleaded for their reinstatement.   A number
of workers have also filed statements with the Labour Inspectorate alleging
unjustified dismissal and these are being examined.

	44.	In its communication of 14 October 1985, the Government states that
the FPU did not submit any application to the authorities concerned to
hold public celebrations on May Day 1985.   However, an unregistered body
(Organisation Southern Unity) had applied for permission to stage a public
show on 1 May.   According to the Government, that organisation did not
produce any documentary evidence proving that permission had been obtained
from the appropriate authorities for the use of the premises where the
show was to be performed.   In addition, the Censorship Board found the
show unsuitable for young persons.   Consequently, the holding of the show
was not authorised but the organisation was given leave to organise a procession
in the south of the country.

C.
The Committee's conclusions

	45.	As regards the prohibition of May Day celebrations, the Committee
notes from the Government's reply that the prohibition of May Day 1985
festivities did not affect the complainant union since the application
to hold the event was lodged by a body (the Organisation Southern Unity)
which apparently is not trade union in character.   At no time does the
complainant union mention any link with this body although it appears from
a newspaper clipping attached to the complaint that the two organisations
had intended to organise the festivities jointly.   Given the mandate of
the Committee, it considers that this aspect of the case - which does not
affect trade union rights - does not call for further examination.

	46.	As regards the strike on 16-17 May 1985 in several export processing
zone factories and the alleged retaliatory action of the Government (arrests,
withdrawal of union recognition, etc.), the Committee notes the Government's
statements that the strike was unlawful, that the arrests were based on
the violent acts of the individuals concerned and that no cancellation
of the union's registration has been sought.   The Committee observes that
s. 92 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1973 declares strikes unlawful unless
a written report of the industrial dispute has been made to the Minister,
a cooling-off period of 21 days has elapsed and the strike commences within
56 days of notice.   It is therefore clear that the strike in the present
case was unlawful under the legislation in force.   The Committee considers
that it should call the attention of the complainant to Article 8 of Convention
No. 87 which provides that,
in exercising the rights provided for in this
Convention, workers and their organisations shall respect the law of the
land.   The Committee also considers that there is no evidence that the
arrests were made for reasons other than preservation of law and order.

	47.	On the other hand, the Committee notes that the Government mentions
the suspension of some 30 workers and the dismissal of others for participating
in the unlawful strike.   A number of these workers are challenging their
dismissals with the Labour Inspectorate and the Government has interceded
for their reinstatement.   Since the normal processes in connection with
the suspensions (disciplinary hearings) and dismissals (complaints before
the Labour Inspectorate) are under way and the Government has interceded
with the employers for reinstatements, the Committee considers that the
principles of freedom of association have not been called into question
and decides that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.

The Committee's recommendation

	48.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to decide that the case as whole does not call for further examination.

CASES IN WHICH THE COMMITTEE HAS REACHED DEFINITIVE
CONCLUSIONS

Case No. 1040

COMPLAINTS SUBMITTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF
FREE TRADE UNIONS AND THE GENERAL UNION OF CENTRAL AFRICAN
WORKERS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

	49.	The Committee has already examined this case on a number of occasions
and most recently at its May 1984 meeting when, in the absence of any reply
from the Government which had not sent any substantive information in response
to the requests voiced by the Committee in its previous reports, it presented
an interim report to the Governing Body [see 234th Report, paras. 445-484,
approved by the Governing Body at its 226th Session (May-June 1984)].

	50.	At its February 1985 meeting, the Committee noted that the Government
had still not sent the desired information and observations, appealed to
it to transmit its observations as a matter of urgency and indicated that,
in conformity with its procedural rules, it would present a report on the
substance of the case at its
meeting in May 1985 [see 238th Report, para.
20, approved by the Governing Body at its 229th Session (February-March
l985)].

	51.	Since then, the ILO has received two communications from the Government
dated 8 and 22 May 1985.

	52.	The Central African Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association
and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1949 (No. 87), and
the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
Previous examination of the case

	53.	The complaints related mainly to the dissolution by administrative
authority of the General Union of Central African Workers (UGTC) but also
concerned the occupation of the latter's premises, the freezing of its
assets and the censorship imposed on it, as well as a number of dismissals.
Trade union activities in the country were subsequently suspended and
several trade unionists, including the Secretary-General of the UGTC, Sonny Cole,
were arrested.

	54.	The complainants explained that the UGTC had called a general strike
on 15 May 1981 throughout the private sector, following unsuccessful attempts
at collective bargaining with the Government and with the employers.
According to the complainants, the Government had rejected the list of
grievances presented by the workers on the occasion of May Day, although
the list contained demands relating for the most part to the working conditions
of all employed persons.

	55.	On 16 May 1981, the day after the strike, the President of the Republic
dissolved the organisation by decree on the grounds of its alleged uncompromising
attitude in the negotiations with the employers and the Government, its
alleged secret dealings abroad and its illegality arising from the trade
union monopoly status provided for in its by-laws.   The UGTC also alleged
that, 48 hours prior to its dissolution, the authorities recognised a new
central trade union organisation, the National Confederation of Central
African Workers (CNTC).

	56.	Subsequently, the UGTC alleged the dismissal or suspension of a number
of trade unionists and attached to its communication a Ministerial Order
of 23 May 1981 suspending four senior officials from their duties.   It
also enclosed a note from the Ministry ordering the Director-General of
the National Savings Bank of Central Africa to block the account of the
UGTC.

	57.	Furthermore, as soon as it came to power on l September 1981, the
Military Committee of National Reconstruction suspended all the activities
of political parties and national organisations, including trade unions,
throughout the country.

	58.	Following the blocking of the UGTC's assets, the organisation's Secretary-General,
Sonny Cole, lodged a complaint against the Government with the Bangui Court.
The hearing, which should have been held on 17 March 1982, did not take
place because of the arrest of three of the court judges, including the
President of the Administrative Court.

	59.	Lastly, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU)
alleged that Sonny Cole and other trade unionists had been arrested on
2 February 1983 for incitement to strike.

	60.	In its initial replies, the Government confirmed that the UGTC had
been dissolved and explained that, in its opinion, the general strike of
l5 May 1981 had had nothing to do with the conditions of work of employed
persons but had been political in nature.   It affirmed that it had dissolved
the UGTC, which was exercising a trade union monopoly, in order to enable
Central African workers to create freely the trade unions of their own
choosing.

	61.	The Government stated that, since the UGTC had been dissolved, several
central trade union organisations had been set up by the workers themselves:
the National Confederation of Central African Workers (CNTC), the Central
African Confederation of Free Trade Unions (CCSL) and the Central African
Federation of Labour (FCT).   The by-laws of these organisations were being
examined by the Ministry of the Interior.   The Government indicated, however,
that trade union activities had been suspended and that it was therefore
out of the question to recognise the CCSL or any new organisation that
might be set up in the prevailing circumstances.   It acknowledged that
it had blocked the UGTC's bank accounts to safeguard the workers' assets
and explained that the Bangui High Court was making an inventory of the
assets of the former UGTC and would decide how they were to be allocated
to organisations pursuing the same aims.   According to the Government,
the suspension of certain officials was a disciplinary measure taken against
senior administrative officials found guilty of dereliction of duty, whose
professional misconduct constituted lawful grounds for terminating their
contracts of employment.

	62.	According to a statement by a Government representative to the Conference
Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in 1982,
the UGTC's bank deposits disappeared after the UGTC was dissolved, its
officers with power of signature having rushed to the banks to draw cheques
for their own benefit, as could still be proved.   The Government representative
stated that there was nothing to prevent the members of the former UGTC
from establishing a new trade union organisation of their own choosing.

	63.	Addressing the Conference Committee on the Application of Conventions
and Recommendations in 1983, the Government representative indicated that
the Head of State had suspended all trade union and political activities
in order to restore order and stop the trade union being utilised by political
parties.   However, although in
practice political activities were suspended,
trade union activities continued and the National Confederation of Central
African Workers enjoyed freedom of expression.

	64.	With respect to the arrest of Sonny Cole, the Government stated that
the acts of which he was accused were of a political nature.   Sonny Cole
and his fellow trade unionists were later released on l May 1983.

	65.	At its May-June 1984 session the Governing Body approved the following
recommendations of the Committee:

"(a)
The Committee regrets the uncooperative attitude of the Government
as regards this case as a whole.

(b)
In general the Committee wishes to express its deep concern at the seriousness
of the measure to suspend trade union activities which has affected all
aspects of trade union life since September 1981.   It expresses the firm
hope that trade union organisations in the Central African Republic will
be able to resume their activities as rapidly as possible and that all
workers will be able to establish organisations of their choosing, including
an organisation carrying on from the ex-UGTC if they so wish.   It requests
the Government to inform it of any measure it may take with a view to re-establishing
the activities of all trade union organisations that wish to exist in the
country.

(c)
While noting the release of Sonny Cole and his colleagues on the occasion
of the May Day celebrations in 1983, after three months' detention for
incitement to strike, the Committee recalls that the arrest of trade unionists,
and particularly of trade union leaders, for activities connected with
the defence of the interests of workers, constitutes a serious infringement
of civil liberties in general and of trade union rights in particular.

(d)
The Committee requests the Government to communicate the judgement of
the Bangui Court concerning the dissolution of the UGTC and the transfer
of its assets as soon as it has been handed down.

(e)
As regards the arrest of judges of the Bangui Court, including the President
of the Administrative Tribunal, the Committee requests the Government to
indicate whether these arrests were related to the case pending before
the court which concerned the dissolution by administrative authority of
the UGTC and the transfer of its assets.

(f)
The Committee notes that talks between its Chairman and the Government
representative of the Central African Republic took place on 14 June 1983
at the 69th Session of the International Labour Conference concerning the
possibility of an on-the-spot mission to examine all the questions at issue.
The Committee
urges the Government to transmit its reply concerning this
mission, which it considers would be most useful and would enable it to
reach conclusions on this case in full knowledge of the facts."

B.
The Government's reply

	66.	In a telegram of 8 May 1985, the Government informed the Committee
that it was sending a memorandum on the case.   A subsequent communication
dated 9 May 1985 from the Ministry of the Public Service, Labour and Social
Security, containing the Government's detailed explanations on the matter,
reached the ILO on 22 May 1985.

	67.	According to the Government, the dissolution of the UGTC is lawful
inasmuch as the organisation strayed from its essential objective of defending
the occupational, social and economic interests of its members.   The UGTC
had originally been set up under the 1964 Constitution which had institutionalised
a single-party system in the form of the Social Development Movement of
Black Africa (MESAN), implicit in which was the existence of a single central
trade union organisation, the UGTC, representing all occupational trade
unions.

	68.	The Government explained that the dissolution of the UGTC, a single
central trade union organisation that was an instrument of the MESAN, was
the natural consequence, in law, of the institution of a multi-party political
system under the Constitution of 5 February 1981.   In other words, the
Government's decision to dissolve the UGTC is in line with the new Constitution
and therefore lawful.

	69.	The Government goes on to explain that the dissolution of the UGTC
left all workers free to set up organisations of their own choosing and
that three central trade union organisations had been established by the
workers themselves:  the National Confederation of Central African Workers
(CNTC), affiliated to the World Confederation of Labour, on 10 August 1980;
the Central African Federation of Labour (FCT), affiliated to the World
Federation of Trade unions, on 12 July 1981;  and the Central African Confederation
of Free Trade Unions (CCSL), affiliated to the International Confederation
of Free Trade Unions, also in 1981.   The Government admits, however, that
the by-laws of the two last-named organisations are still being examined
by the Ministry of the Interior which is conducting the customary investigation
into the moral standards of their officers in accordance with national
legislation governing associations.

	70.	The Government further explains that, as a result of the establishment
of these central organisations, there had been a serious split within the
UGTC, that the organisation's leaders had been manipulated by the political
parties and by foreign interests and had deviated from its objectives,
that they had incited workers to revolt and that they had thus disrupted
economic activities and law and
order, paralysed the public institutions
and endangered the very life of the nation.   Furthermore, according to
the Government, it was in this climate of insurrection, with the political
parties pressing trade union demands for their own ends, that the Military
Committee of National Reconstruction ordered the suspension of the activities
of all national organisations, including central trade union organisations,
throughout the country.

	71.	With respect to the restitution of the former UGTC's assets, the Government
states that the Court has not yet handed down its judgement on the matter.
It reiterates its earlier statement that the organisation's local bank
deposits were withdrawn on 19 May 1981 by the former leaders of the UGTC
who had used them for their own purposes.   In the Government's view, it
was only logical that they be asked to account for their actions.   The
Government adds that the alleged arrest of the Bangui Court judges was
quite unrelated to the case pending before the court.

	72.	Finally, the Government continues, it was in the wake of a wildcat
strike held by workers in the private sector to block a government decision
to extend to private sector workers the exceptional contribution to national
reconstruction that had hitherto been required only from workers in the
employ of the State that a number of trade unionists, including former
UGTC Secretary-General Sonny Cole and his colleagues, had been arrested
in January 1983 following a police investigation for incitement to an illegal
strike that was tantamount to a revolt against the legitimate authority
of the State.   On May Day of 1983, however, they had been released and
reinstated in their duties, according to the Government.

	73.	With respect to the resumption of trade union activities, the Government
states that the purpose of the "trade union truce" which it called in September
l981 had been to bring about a climate of peace and security in which to
revive the national economy after 15 years of plunder and ruin and to extricate
the nation from the deplorable situation brought about by the irresponsible
behaviour of the political parties, of the organisations that were their
instruments and of certain politicised trade union leaders.   The Government
assures the Committee that it will in due course order the general resumption
of trade union activities once a climate conducive to harmonious development
has been restored and the sources of economic and social disruption have
been eradicated;  for the time being, however, no new development warrants
its reconsidering its decision and thus risking a return to the situation
that obtained prior to September 1981.

	74.	In conclusion, the Government believes that the complaints considered
by the Committee in the present case should be dropped inasmuch as there
is no new element to justify their further consideration in the present
circumstances, since the suspension of the activities of national organisations
is a general measure that is not specifically directed at trade unions,
the right to organise continues to exist in the Central African Republic
in accordance with
its international commitments;  a recognised trade union
organisation, the National Confederation of Central African Workers, is
collaborating with the public authorities and the employers in tripartite
bodies operating at the national and international level;  and the Government's
decision which is the object of the complaint prohibits only demonstrations
or activities of organisations liable to be politicised or to disturb the
peace and disrupt the economy during the current period of national reconstruction.

	75.	Speaking before the Committee on the Application of Conventions and
Recommendations of the International Labour Conference in 1985, the Government
representative reiterated the explanations that his Government had given
in its written communication of 9 May 1985.   Regarding the possible date
of resumption of trade union activities, he stated that he was not qualified
to furnish any information on the subject but that, although the Military
Committee had banned all national demonstrations, the Government had called
on the workers to take part in the ceremonies that were to be held to commemorate
the national holiday, which could be looked upon as a positive sign.

C.
The Committee's conclusions

	76.	In the first place, the Committee deplores the fact that it was only
after it had sent the Government two urgent appeals in February 1984 and
February 1985 that the latter sent a memorandum on the subject on 9 May
l985.   Moreover, the memorandum on the whole provides very little additional
information.

	77.	The Committee regrets particularly that the Government should have
chosen not to respond to its proposal and that of the Governing Body that
direct contacts be initiated.   Considering the importance and gravity
of the matters raised in the complaints and the inadequate information
supplied by the Government, the Committee is convinced that an on-the-spot
mission by a representative of the Director-General would have helped to
shed light on the trade union situation and contributed to a useful examination
of appropriate solutions to the existing problems.

	78.	The Committee therefore feels obliged to recall that the purpose of
the procedure that has been initiated is to secure the respect of trade
union freedoms
de jure
and
de facto
and that it is convinced that, just
as it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the governments
themselves must surely recognise the importance of their submitting detailed
replies to the allegations made against them so that they can be examined
objectively.

	79.	The Committee recalls that the complaints originally submitted in
this case related to the dissolution of the UGTC which was ordered by decree
No. 81/216 signed by the President of the
Republic on 16 May 1981.   Although
the Committee notes the Government's repeated explanations regarding the
trade union monopoly status exercised by the UGTC and the creation of a
pluralistic trade union movement in accordance with the Constitution, the
fact remains that a trade union organisation was dissolved by administrative
authority in clear violation of Article 4 of Convention No. 87 ratified
by the Central African Republic.

	80.	The dissolution of the UGTC naturally raises the question of the restitution
of the funds and assets belonging to the organisation.   The Committee
observes that the Government itself recognises that the Court examining
the case has not yet handed down its judgement.   Under the circumstances,
the Committee cannot but reiterate the principle that, when an organisation
is dissolved, its assets should eventually be distributed among its former
members or handed over to the organisation that succeeds it;  this must
be taken to mean the organisation or organisations which pursue the aims
for which the dissolved union was established and which pursue them in
the same spirit.   [See, for example, 174th Report, Case No. 900 (Spain),
para. 258, and 209th Report, Case No. 763 (Uruguay), para. 78].

	81.	The application of this principle implies that the workers should
have the right to set up organisations of their own choosing and, in particular,
should be able, if they so desire, to establish an organisation that genuinely
takes over from the UGTC.   In this regard, the Committee notes the Government's
repeated statements that the purpose of dissolving the UGTC was precisely
in order to make possible trade union pluralism.   It also notes the Government's
further affirmation that several central trade union organisations were
set up following the dissolution of the UGTC.   The Committee must, however,
observe that the Government itself recognises that only the CNTC has been
legally registered and that the by-laws of the two other organisations
set up in 1981 are still being examined by the Ministry of the Interior
in 1985.   Moreover, the delegation of the Central African Republic to
the 71st Session of the International Labour Conference in 1985 apparently
included no representative of these two central organisations.   The Committee
therefore calls upon the Government as a matter of great urgency to take
steps to ensure that the workers are able both under the law and in practice
to establish the organisations of their own choosing, in accordance with
Article 2 of Convention No. 87.   It calls upon the Government to indicate
the current status of the property of the former UGTC, including both its
fixed and its liquid assets, and the reasons why the Bangui Court which
has been examining the matter of the restitution of the assets of this
organisation since 1982 has not yet handed down its judgement.

	82.	With regard to the cancellation of trade union activities, which in
the Central African Republic is known as the "trade union truce", the Committee
notes that, according to the Government, trade union activities in the
country are in practice normal and that the CNTC enjoys freedom of expression.
The Committee observes, nevertheless, that the Government itself admits
that the free exercise
of trade union rights applies only to one central
organisation.   The Government has moreover recognised that the fact that
trade union activities are suspended prevents it from recognising any new
organisation that might be set up in the prevailing circumstances.   The
Committee must therefore emphasise that all workers in the Central African
Republic should have the right to engage freely in the defence and promotion
of their economic and social interests through central organisations of
their choice.

	83.	The Committee considers that a return to normal trade union life must
be the objective of the Government, which has ratified Conventions Nos.
87 and 98 and is consequently required to apply them.   The Committee is
therefore of the opinion that the question of the restitution of the assets
of the former UGTC, that of the cancellation of trade union activities
and that of the non-registration of the by-laws deposited in 1981 by the
Central African Federation of Labour and the Central African Confederation
of Free Trade Unions all warrant being brought to the attention of the
Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.

The Committee's recommendations

	84.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions:

(a)
the Committee deplores that, despite the assurances given to the Chairman
of the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Conference Committee
on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations at a number of sessions
of the International Labour Conference, the Government has not taken steps
to restore freedom of association in the Central African Republic;

(b)
the Committee deeply deplores the fact that it should have had to send
the Government two urgent appeals in February 1984 and February 1985 before
the latter sent detailed information on this matter and regrets that it
has not chosen to take up the proposal for a direct contacts mission to
be sent to the country;

(c)
the Committee notes that the dissolution of the General Union of Central
African Workers was pronounced by administrative authority, in violation
of Article 4 of Convention No. 87 ratified by the Central African Republic;

(d)
the Committee recalls that the assets of an organisation which has been
dissolved should be distributed among its former members or handed over
to the organisation that succeeds it, by which is meant the organisation
or organisations which pursue the same aims in the same spririt.   It calls
upon the Government to indicate the current status of the property of the
former UGTC,
including both its fixed and its liquid assets, and the reasons
why the Bangui Court that has been examining the matter of the restitution
of the assets of this organisation since 1982 has not yet handed down its
judgement;
(e)
the Committee calls upon the Government as a matter of great urgency
to take steps to ensure that the workers are able both under the law and
in practice to establish organisations of their own choosing, in accordance
with Article 2 of Convention No. 87, which has been ratified by the Central
African Republic;

(f)
the Committee emphasises that all workers in the Central African Republic
should have the right to engage freely in the defence and promotion of
their economic and social interests through the central organisations of
their own choice;

(g)
the Committee draws the entire case to the attention of the Committee
of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, and specifically
the question of the cancellation of trade union activities declared under
the "trade union truce" and that of the failure to register the by-laws
deposited since 1981 by two Central African central trade union organisations
which the Ministry of the Interior has now been examining for four years.
The Committee considers this to be in flagrant breach of the Conventions
on freedom of association which have been ratified by the Central African
Republic.

Cases Nos. 1098, 1132, 1254, 1257, 1290, 1299 and 1316

COMPLAINTS PRESENTED BY SEVERAL TRADE UNION
ORGANISATIONS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF URUGUAY

	85.	On 26 August 1985, the Government sent information on Cases Nos. 1098,
1132, 1254, 1257, 1290, 1299 and 1316 concerning allegations of infringements
of freedom of association presented by numerous workers' organisations.
Its communication contained details of the steps taken since the Government
assumed power on 1 March 1985 to halt the deterioration in the trade union
situation in Uruguay and restore democracy.   The Committee intends to
examine all these cases, which relate to a trade union situation that arose
under the regime that came to power as a result of the military takeover
in 1973, in a single document.

	86.	Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of
the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
General statement by the Government

	87.	In its letter of 26 August 1985, the Government states that the process
of institutionalising democracy, and therefore of remedying the trade union
situation, began on 1 March 1985.   It recalls that it sent a representative
to the May 1985 meeting of the Committee on Freedom of Association to explain
what was happening and that a government representative informed the Governing
Body of the ILO that a democratic Uruguay had now returned to the Organisation
which was aware of its responsibilities and prepared to respect its commitments.
The Government goes on to supply details of the various cases before
the Committee.

B.  The complaints

Cases Nos. 1098 and 1132

	88.	The complaints still pending concern the alleged arrest of trade unionists
Luís Washington Rodríguez Belleti of the sugarworkers' union and Rubén
Bello of the portworkers' union.   At its May 1985 meeting, the Committee
noted the information communicated by the Government in March 1985 to the
effect that one of the trade unionists cited by the complainants was in
hiding and that another had not been released after the declaration of
an amnesty.   The Committee requested the Government to indicate the grounds
for the sentences passed on these two trade union leaders.   [See 239th
Report, para. 209, approved by the Governing Body at its 230th Session
(May-June 1985).]

	89.	The Government has replied that the trade unionists referred to have
been released, that no charge has been brought against them, that they
have not been sentenced and that no legal proceedings have been initiated.

Cases Nos. 1254, 1257, 1299 and 1316

	90.	The complaints presented under these cases refer to the dismissal
of public servants and teachers for trade union reasons and the questioning
at police headquarters of members of the Co-ordinating Committee for the
Teaching Profession in connection with a public meeting in February 1984
(Case No. 1254), to the arrest of union members and the dissolution of
the Inter-Union Workers' Assembly (PIT) (Case No. 1257), to the excessive
restrictions on the right to strike imposed in 1984 by the law on strikes
and the decree made under it (Case No. 1299) and to the Government's withdrawal
of the credentials of the Workers' delegation of Uruguay to the First Session
of the Food and Drink Industries Committee held at the ILO in Geneva on
5 December 1984 (Case No. 1316).

	91.	The Government recalls that these complaints arose out of the earlier
situation to which it refers in its general statement, namely the refusal
to constitute a tripartite delegation and the law on trade unions that
was in force at the time.   It points out that Act No. 15738 of 13 March
1985, of which it encloses a copy, repeals the so-called "Acts" Nos. 14248
(on the democratic oath), 15137 (on occupational associations), 15530 (on
strikes) and 15587 (on trade union immunity) and the so-called "Fundamental
Acts" Nos. 3 (on strikes by public servants), 5 and 6 (on stability of
employment of state employees working under contract) and 7 (on the redeployment
of public servants).   The Government explains that, as a result of the
repeal of this legislation, their juridical effects were annulled and that,
consequently, international labour Conventions Nos. 87 and 98 are now fully
applicable and may, if necessary, be cited in a court of law.   Moreover,
Decree No. 97/985 of 1 March 1985, of which the Government encloses a copy,
revokes the resolutions adopted by the previous "de facto" Government,
including the resolution dissolving the National Workers' Convention (CNT)
and the Inter-Union Workers' Assembly (PIT), both of which were, according
to the Government, immediately able to resume their trade union activities
under perfectly normal conditions.

Case No. 1290

	92.	This complaint concerns the alleged dismissal of trade unionists employed
by the "Nicolás González" international freight transport undertaking.
The Government had stated that one of the trade union leaders had been
reinstated in his job following a conciliation meeting presided over by
the administrative authority and, at its November 1984 meeting, the Committee
had requested the Government to communicate the result of the administrative
proceedings concerning the other union members.   [See 236th Report, para. 390.]

	93.	The Government replies that the complainants have not re-presented
their demands to the new administrative authorities and have not lodged
any appeal with the competent courts.

C.
The Committee's conclusions

	94.	The Committee notes with satisfaction the information communicated
by the Government on these cases and, specifically, the repeal of the earlier
trade union legislation which was the subject of several complaints, the
revoking of the resolutions dissolving the National Workers' Convention
(CNT) and the Inter-Union Workers' Assembly (PIT) and the resumption by
these two organisations of their trade union activities in Uruguay.

	95.	The Committee trusts that the Government of Uruguay will soon institute
a system of labour relations which has the support of
the interested parties;
it will be for the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions
and Recommendations to examine subsequent developments.

The Committee's recommendations

	96.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:

(a)
The Committee notes with satisfaction that the earlier trade union legislation
which was the subject of complaints by several workers' organisations has
been repealed and that the National Workers' Convention and the Inter-union
Workers' Assembly are now participating legally in the trade union life
of the country.

(b)
The Committee trusts that the Government will soon institute a system
of labour relations which has the support of the parties concerned;  it
will be for the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions
and Recommendations to examine subsequent developments in the trade union
situation.

Cases Nos. 1172, 1234, 1247 and 1260

COMPLAINTS PRESENTED BY THE CANADIAN LABOUR CONGRESS,
THE WORLD CONFEDERATION OF ORGANISATIONS OF THE TEACHING
PROFESSION AND THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA (ONTARIO), BY THE CANADIAN
LABOUR CONGRESS ON BEHALF OF THE ALBERTA UNION OF PROVINCIAL
EMPLOYEES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA (ALBERTA), BY THE
CONFEDERATION OF ALBERTA FACULTY ASSOCIATIONS AGAINST THE
GOVERNMENT OF CANADA (ALBERTA) AND BY THE CANADIAN LABOUR
CONGRESS ON BEHALF OF THE NEWFOUNDLAND ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC
EMPLOYEES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA (NEWFOUNDLAND)

	97.	The complaint (Case No. 1172) of the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC),
on behalf of its affiliated organisations the National Union of Provincial
Government Employees (NUPGE), the Ontario Public Service Employees Union
(OPSEU) and the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), is contained
in a communication dated 15 November 1982.   The CLC supplied additional
information in communications dated 15 December 1982, 16 February and 28
October 1983 and 10 January 1984.   The World Confederation of Organisations
of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP), presented its complaint, on behalf
of its affiliates the Canadian Teachers Federation and the Ontario Teachers
Federation, in a letter of 8 February 1983 and further information in
a
communication of 7 March 1983.   The Service Employees International Union
(SEIU) presented its complaint in a letter dated 6 April 1984.  The Government
sent its observations in communications dated 25 April 1983 and 7 June
and 16 October 1984.

	98.	The Confederation of Alberta Faculty Associations (CAFA) presented
a complaint (Case No. 1234) of violations of trade union rights against
the Government of Canada/Alberta in a communication dated 19 September
1983.   The Government supplied its observations in a communication dated
21 February 1984.

	99.	The Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) presented a complaint (Case No.
1247) of infringements of trade union rights in Alberta in a communication
dated 1 November 1983 on behalf of the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees
(AUPE), a component of the National Union of Provincial Government Employees
(NUPGE) which is the CLC's second largest affiliate.   The Government transmitted
its observations in a communication dated 3 May 1984.

	100.	The Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) presented a complaint (Case No.
1260) of infringements of trade union rights in Newfoundland in a communication
dated 3 February 1984 on behalf of the Newfoundland Association of Public
Employees (NAPE), a component of the National Union of Provincial Government
Employees (NUPGE) which is affiliated to the CLC.   The Government transmitted
its observations in a communication dated 29 May 1984.

	101.	The Governing Body Committee on Freedom of Association, at its meeting
in November 1984 [236th Report, para. 7, approved by the Governing Body
at its 228th Session, November 1984], decided to postpone its examination
of the cases concerning Ontario, Alberta and Newfoundland since it was
of the view that, before reaching conclusions in these cases, it would
be necessary to obtain additional information, particularly through a study
and information mission, which could assist in clarifying aspects of the
laws and practices involved.   The Committee accordingly requested the
Government to indicate its consent to such a procedure.

	102.	In a letter dated 1 February 1985 the Government indicated that,
after consultation with the various provincial governments concerned, it
had no objection to such a mission taking place.

	103.	In its 238th Report, para. 10 [approved by the Governing Body at
its 229th Session, February-March 1985], the Committee explained that the
study and information mission would take place within the context of its
examination of the cases.   It emphasised that its proposal for such a
mission stemmed from a desire on its part to reach conclusions in as full
a knowledge and understanding as possible of the complex issues involved.
It said that it was convinced that its work would be greatly facilitated
by an on-the-spot appreciation of the day-to-day practical operation, in
local conditions, of the legislation that was the subject of the complaints.

	104.	Arrangements were accordingly made for a study and information mission
to take place in Canada - in particular, the Provinces of Ontario, Alberta
and Newfoundland - from 12 to 25 September 1985.   The Director-General
of the ILO appointed Sir John Wood, CBE, LLM, as his representative to
carry out the mission;  he was accompanied during the mission by Mr. William
R. Simpson, Chief of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International
Labour Standards Department and Mrs. Jane Hodges, an official of the Freedom
of Association Branch.   The report of the representative of the Director-General
is annexed to this paper.

	105.	Canada has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of
the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87);  it has not ratified the
Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98) or
the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention, 1978 (No. 151).

	106.	The Committee wishes first to express its deep appreciation to Sir
John Wood for having undertaken this study and information mission as representative
of the Director-General.   It is thanks to his detailed report on all the
cases examined that the Committee has been able to reach its conclusions
in a fuller knowledge and with a greater understanding of the complex issues
involved in these cases.   In the view of the Committee, the report of
the representative of the Director-General clearly demonstrates the usefulness
of missions of this kind especially in difficult cases where, despite the
voluminous documentation submitted by the parties, on-the-spot discussions
can throw much additional light on the problems involved.

	107.	The Committee also wishes to express its thanks to the Government
of Canada and to the Governments of the Provinces of Alberta, Ontario and
Newfoundland for their co-operation with the mission.   It also thanks
the representatives of the Canadian Labour Congress, the National Union
of Provincial Government Employees and those of the many other international,
national or provincial unions who assisted the representative of the Director-General
in carrying out his mandate.

	108.	Since the complaints and the replies of the various governments,
as well as the information obtained during the mission, have all been fully
analysed in the report of the representative of the Director-General, it
only remains for the Committee to proceed to the formulation of its conclusions
in the cases which it has now fully examined.

A.
The Committee's conclusions on Case No. 1172/Ontario

	109.	The Committee has taken note of all the information contained in
the various complaints submitted in this case, the reply transmitted by
the Government of the Province of Ontario and the detailed information
obtained by the representative of the Director-General during the study
and information mission.

	110.	The allegations in this case concern the enactment, in 1982, of the
Inflation Restraint Act (or Bill 179) which came into effect on 21 September
of that year.   Since September 1983 Bill 179 is no longer in force, having
been replaced by a further enactment, on 10 October 1983, known as the
Public Sector Prices and Compensation Review Act (or Bill 111).   No formal
complaint has been submitted regarding this latter enactment.   Since,
however, as the representative of the Director-General has pointed out
in his report, it is directly relevant to the issues raised in the complaint
and is the latest act by the Government in the area of public sector collective
bargaining, the Committee considers it appropriate to express its views
on this legislation which, it notes, was also due to expire at the end
of September 1985.   The Committee further observes that the representative
of the Director-General was able, during his mission, to obtain the views
both of the unions and of the Government on the content and effects of
Bill 111.

	111.	Bill 179 was enacted in the face of what the Government considerd
as an emergency situation requiring action to counter rising inflation.
It placed restrictions on collective bargaining for provincial public
servants and employees of semi-public provincial institutions.   The provisions
of the Act have the effect of extending for a period of 12 months compensation
plans that were in the process of negotiation or due to expire during the
period from 1 October 1982 to 30 September 1983.

	112.	The complainants have alleged that, although they were consulted
about future government action, their observations and opinions went unheeded.
In their opinion the economic situation at that time did not warrant
emergency legislative measures being taken to restrain public service incomes.

	113.	On this first point, the Committee notes from the report of the representative
of the Director-General that there has been a lively debate as to the depth
or even the existence of economic problems, but that, particularly in the
present case, the Government was convinced that the economic situation
in the province demanded urgent attention.   Whatever the situation, there
were, in the Government's view, obvious economic problems which it decided
to tackle through the application of wage restraint legislation in the
public sector.   It is not for the Committee to question the economic arguments
that formed the basis of that view or of the action that the Government
took.

	114.	It is, however, for the Committee to express its views on the question
whether, in taking such action, the Government went beyond what the Committee
has considered to be acceptable limits that might be placed temporarily
on free collective bargaining.

	115.	In the first place, the immediate effect of the legislation (Bill
179) was to limit public sector wage increases, for a period which did
not exceed one year, to 5 per cent (in some cases 9 per cent).   In this
respect, the Committee recalls that it had acknowledged that stabilisation
measures restricting the right to collective bargaining are acceptable
on condition that they are of an exceptional nature, and only to the extent
that they are necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period, and that
they are accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living
standards.   The Committee considers, on the basis of all the information
now at its disposal, that, in the present case, all these criteria were
met or at least serious efforts were made by the Government to respect
these criteria.

	116.	Another immediate effect of Bill 179 was to reduce increases negotiated
in compensation plans prior to the date on which the legislation became
applicable where such increases exceeded those provided for in the Act.
While the Committee appreciates that the introduction of wage restraint
measures must be timed in order to obtain the maximum impact on the economic
situation, it nevertheless considers that the interruption of already negotiated
contracts is not in conformity with the principles of free collective bargaining
because such contracts should be respected.

	117.	As regards the complainants' original allegations that Bill 179 not
only imposed financial restrictions but also interrupted all trade union
activity, including the right to bargain on non-monetary items and the
right to change bargaining agents, the Committee notes that, from a strictly
legal point of view, these arguments were proved to be unfounded by the
Ontario Court of Appeal in the Broadway Manor case.   This decision, however,
was handed down too late to be of any practical assistance to the parties
during the  control period and it is clear that, despite the Court's ruling,
much difficulty and tension were caused as a result of the problems that
arose on these matters.   It is clear that bargaining on non-monetary items
was obstructed during the course of the legislation so as not to undermine
the intended financial control.   It is also clear that it was the Government's
intention to prevent  any change in the bargaining agent during the restraint
period in order, according to the representative of the Director-General,
to secure as much industrial relations tranquility as possible during that
period.   The Committee is of the view that, where wage restraint measures
are taken by a Government to impose financial controls, care should be
taken to ensure that collective bargaining on non-monetary matters can
be pursued and that unions and their members can fully exercise their normal
trade union activity.

	118.	The Committee further notes that forceful arguments were submitted
by the unions that the regular industrial relations machinery had been
adversely affected by Bill 179 and subsequently by Bill 111.   The fixed
norm imposed by Bill 179 in effect constituted a substitute for arbitration.
Under Bill 111 the unions argue, the freedom to bargain as well as the
freedom of interest arbitrators is severely curtailed by the necessity
to take account of the ability of the employer to pay as well as government
fiscal policy.   Questions were also raised concerning the independence
of arbitrators.

	119.	Bill 111, the Committee observes, was introduced as a substitute
for Bill 179 and removed many of the restrictions on wage bargaining that
Bill 179 had been designed to cover.   Bill 111, however, it seems clear,
did constitute - although in a much less rigid manner - a continuation
of the policy of restraint by the introduction of such concepts as "the
employer's ability to pay" and "government fiscal policy" as criteria for
consideration in arriving at wage settlements.   There was much controversy,
even amongst arbitrators, as to the extent to which these criteria actually
influenced bargaining  and arbitration awards or whether they were indeed
at all times taken into account.

	120.	The Committee would emphasise, in this connection, that restrictions
on the right to strike in the public service or in essential services should
be compensated by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration
proceedings.   The Committee would also emphasise that the independence
and impartiality of the arbitration system are paramount.   If, however,
as in the present case, arbitrators are directly appointed by a government
which lays down in legislation certain criteria which arbitrators are bound
to follow in the determination of awards it is inevitable that confidence
in the system will diminish.

	121.	In the view of the Committee, the expiry of Bill 111 now renders
possible a return to a normal situation in which collective bargaining
can take place freely with recourse being available, when appropriate,
to arbitration.   The loss of confidence of the unions and other residual
negative effects on industrial relations that have resulted from the recent
wage restraint legislation could, at least to some extent, be offset by
consideration being given by the Government, in consultation with the unions,
to ensuring that the arbitration system, including the selection of arbitrators,
enjoys the fullest possible confidence of all the parties.

The Committee's recommendations

	122.	The Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this part
of the report and in particular the following conclusions:
(a)
The Committee is of the view that, in general, the Inflation Restraint
Act (Bill 179) did not go beyond what the Committee has previously considered
to be normally acceptable limits that might be placed temporarily on collective
bargaining;

(b)
The Committee, however, considers that the interruption, by Bill 179,
of contracts that had been already negotiated is not in conformity with
the principles of free collective bargaining because such contracts should
be respected;

(c)
The Committee would emphasise that, where wage restraint measures are
taken by a government to impose financial controls, care should be taken
to ensure that collective bargaining on non-monetary matters can be pursued
and that unions and their members can fully exercise their normal trade
union activity;

(d)
The Committee stresses that restrictions on the right to strike in public
or essential services should be compensated by adequate, speedy and impartial
conciliation and arbitration proceedings;

(e)
The Committee would express the hope that, since the legislation which
was the subject of complaint has now expired, the Government, in consultation
with the unions, will endeavour to overcome any residual negative effects
of that legislation on industrial relations;  more particularly, the Committee
hopes that the arbitration system, and the procedures for the selection
of arbitrators, will be revised in such a manner as to ensure that they
enjoy the fullest confidence possible of all the parties.

B.
The Committee's conclusions on Case No. 1234/Alberta

	123.	The Committee notes that this case concerns allegations that amendments
to the Universities Act deny freedom of association to faculty staff by
empowering the employers (the Boards of Governors) to determine the membership
of academic staff associations.   The complainant cites the negative effect
of the amendments on staff association membership at Athabasca University.

	124.	The Committee observes that this situation arises from the combined
effect of two provisions of the Act, namely section 21.2(2) which defines
"academic staff association" as a body consisting of "academic staff members",
and section 17(1)(d.1) which empowers the Boards of Governors to designate
"academic staff members".   Although the Government's written reply stresses
that the university environment requires a special approach to the employer-employee
relationship because of the involvement of faculty staff in all levels
of university management, it acknowledges that the employer at
Athabasca
University - after consultation with the faculty association - altered
its restrictive designation of "academic staff members".

	125.	It appears from the report of the representative of the Director-General
that only at Athabasca University did the employer's use of its designation
power lead to problems.   In the three other universities of the Province,
designations of "academic staff members" were arrived at without difficulty
in consultation with the faculty associations.   Moreover, it appears that
the peculiar circumstances at Athabasca University (namely, that it is
an open university and was recently transferred from the provincial capital
to a town in the north of Alberta) might have led to misunderstandings
regarding the employer's restrictive designation of academic staff at that
particular point in time.   In any event, the Committee notes that designations
have now been made in all four provincial universities to the satisfaction
of both sides.

	126.	What remains is the fear that future designations could be made to
exclude faculty members and non-management administrative or planning personnel
from membership of the staff associations whose purpose is to protect and
defend the interests of these categories of workers.   If designated as
non-academic, these workers - who are specifically excluded from the Labour
Relations Act and the Public Service Employee Relations Act - would have
no possibility of forming or joining an association to further their interests.
In these circumstances the Committee draws the Government's attention
to the terms of Article 2 of Convention No. 87, ratified by Canada, which
guarantee the right of all workers, without distinction whatsoever, to
join or establish organisations of their own choosing.   The particular
circumstances of university decision-making in Alberta do not appear to
the Committee to justify any restriction on this right through the vesting
of wide designation powers in the employer body.   The Committee recalls
that it already came to this conclusion in its examination of past cases
concerning the Provincial Government of Alberta to which the complainant
refers in its written complaint.

	127.	The Committee accordingly considers that, in order to ensure full
compliance with the principle of Article 2 of Convention No. 87, measures
should be taken to repeal section 17(1)(d.1) and introduce an independent
system of designation where agreement cannot be reached (for example, as
suggested during the study and information mission, third party arbitration
machinery).   The Committee stresses this latter point because although
the report of the representative of the Director-General indicates that
consultations between the parties have led to satisfactory designations,
the Provincial Government pointed out during the mission that it could
not envisage any major change in policy regarding the Universities Act.
The Committee is of the opinion that some independent machinery should
be available, if necessary, to assist in the designation of "academic staff
members" for the purpose of joining an academic staff association.   Machinery
such as that referred to in the report of the representative of the Director-General
could alleviate the complainant's fear of abuse of section 17(1)(d.1).

Recommendations of the Committee

	128.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve this part of the report and, in particular, to request the Government
to take measures to repeal the provision in the Universities Act which
empowers the employer body to determine the membership of academic staff
associations.   The Committee also recommends that consideration be given
to the possibility of introducing an independent system for the designation,
where necessary, of academic staff members, either through third party
arbitration or some form of informal machinery as referred to in the report
of the representative of the Director-General.

C.
The Committee's conclusions on Case No. 1247/Alberta

	129.	The Committee notes that this case concerns allegations that 1983
amendments (contained in Bill 44) to the Labour Relations Act and the Public
Service Employee Relations Act of Alberta, on the one hand, restrict freedom
of association by excluding numerous employees from bargaining units, and,
on the other hand, interfere with the right of workers' organisations to
organise their activities in full freedom by restricting the collective
bargaining process and rendering the previously impartial arbitration system
subject to government fiscal policy.

	130.	First, the Committee notes that, although not referred to in the
written complaint, section 93 of the Public Service Employee Relations
Act which bans the right to strike of provincial government employees was
brought to the attention of the study and information mission.   The Committee
considers that an examination of this provision is important since it sets
the background against which the formal allegations must be viewed.   The
AUPE claims that the Government's main justifications for this total ban
on provincial public service strikes is that the employees concerned were
so closely linked to those providing essential services as to make it reasonable
to treat them in the same way and that there is no alternative supply for
these services.   AUPE made the point that section 93 does not apply to
public servants employed by municipalities and school boards and it told
the representative of the Director-General that there was no evidence of
close links between essential and non-essential persons such that a strike
by the latter would hinder the provision of essential services.   Nor was
there any evidence that there was no alternative source of supply for the
services provided by the employees affected.

	131.	The Committee recalls that it has been called to examine the strike
ban in a previous case submitted against the Government of Canada/Alberta
[Case No. 893, most recently examined in the 204th Report, paras. 121 to
134, approved by the Governing Body at its 214th
Session (November 1980).].
In that case the Committee recalled that the right to strike, recognised
as deriving from Article 3 of the Convention, is an essential means by
which workers may defend their occupational interests.   It also recalled
that, if limitations on strike action are to be applied by legislation,
a distinction should be made between publicly-owned undertakings which
are genuinely essential, i.e. those which supply services whose interruption
would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part
of the population, and those which are not essential in the strict sense
of the term.   The Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, drew
the attention of the Government to this principle and suggested to the
Government that it consider the possibility of introducing an amendment
to the Public Service Employee Relations Act in order to confine the prohibition
of strikes to services which are essential in the strict sense of the term.
In the present case, the Committee would again draw attention to its
previous conclusions on section 93 of the Act.

	132.	Linked to this question of restrictions on the right to strike is
one of the specific written allegations, namely that an amendment contained
in Bill 44 to section 117.1 of the Labour Relations Act prohibits the right
to strike of all hospital employees.   The Committee notes that this broad
exclusion covers kitchen help, janitors, gardeners, etc. but that the Government
told the representative of the Director-General that only small groups
were affected by section 117.1 and that this question was, in any event,
being challenged in the Alberta Court of Appeal and the Canadian Supreme
Court.   Given that this provision is not sufficiently specific as regards
the important qualification of "essential employee", the Committee refers
to the principle set out in the above paragraph concerning circumstances
in which recourse to strike action may be prohibited.   It requests the
Government to re-examine section 117.1 so as to confine the prohibition
of strikes to services which are essential in the strict sense of the term.

	133.	As regards the exclusion from the collective bargaining process of
disbursement control officers, hearing officers and employees performing
substantially similar duties, as well as employees in the Legislative Assembly
Office, Auditor General's, Electoral Office and Ombudsman's Office (section 21(1)(g)
and (h) of the Public Service Employee Relations Act), the Committee notes
from the Government's written reply that the previous situation has not
been altered, but has been "further refined".   It also notes from the
information contained in the report of the representative of the Director-General
that these amendments to section 21(1) were a legislative reversal of several
decisions of the Public Service Employee Relations Board.   Moreover, during
the study and information mission, the AUPE expressed concern over a 1985
amendment to section 21(1)(l) which allows exclusion "for any other reason".
Although disputes over subsection (1) exclusions may be referred to the
Board for decision under section 21(2), the AUPE remained suspicious of
the wide ambit of possible exclusions;  they stated that, in practice,
over 400 employees had been denied access to the collective bargaining
process by these amendments to section 21.   The Government, on the other
hand, told the mission that only 260 employees had been affected, all being
mainly involved in the managerial/personnel policy area.

	134.	In the light of the voluminous information provided to the mission
as to the non-managerial nature of some of these employees' tasks, the
Committee would draw the Government's attention to the principle that only
civil servants engaged in the administration of the State (i.e. employed
in various capacities in government ministries or comparable bodies) and
not other persons employed by the Government, by public undertakings or
by independent public corporations, can be excluded from the guarantees
of collective bargaining.   Under this criterion, the Committee cannot
accept that all the public employees now listed in section 21(1) should
be excluded from representation in the collective bargaining process.
It accordingly requests the Government to reconsider this section in the
light of this principle.

	135.	Although not referred to in the written complaint, much information
was given to the mission on section 48(2) of the Public Service Employee
Relations Act which limits the subject-matters which may be referred to
arbitration.   According to the AUPE, although the Board may determine
disputes as to whether certain items are non-arbitral, the unions have
lost all confidence in the Board because of its recent decisions in this
area which, the union claims, regard all matters as part of the managerial
prerogative of the employer and thus not appropriate for arbitration.
Moreover, the AUPE claimed that the Board often delayed or prevented reference
of whole bargaining disputes to arbitration.   The Committee takes note
of the information on this question reflected in the report of the representative
of the Director-General since it forms part of the background to the second
main allegation in the present case, namely that Bill 44 has damaged, if
not destroyed, the arbitration system.   More specifically, it is claimed
by the union that the arbitration system has been weakened by the use of
a procedural body (the Public Service Employee Relations Board) to screen
issues before they reach arbitration.   The Committee also notes the examples
that were given to the misson of matters that had been considered by the
Board as not being appropriate for submission to arbitration (e.g. hours
of work, certain leave periods, transfer, promotion, etc.).   The Committee
has emphasised that restrictions on the right to strike in the public service
or in essential services should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and
speedy conciliation and arbitration in which the parties can take part
at every stage and on which the awards, once made, are binding on both
parties.   The Committee is of the view that the existing system, under
which the Public Service Employee Relations Board can prevent the referral
to arbitration of matters which have formed the basis of a dispute, is
not fully in accordance with ILO principles and is one which has led to
considerable tension between the parties and to a loss of confidence by
the unions in the arbitration machinery.

	136.	As regards the alleged interference in the arbitration process itself
by the listing of factors - including government fiscal policies - to be
taken into account by arbitrators in reaching awards (section 117.8 of
the Labour Relations Act and section 55 of the Public Service Employee
Relations Act), the Committee notes the Government's written reply that
various factors are merely listed in the legislation without indications
as to the importance which the arbitration boards should give them.   The
Committee observes from the report of the representative of the Director-General
that, in practice, arbitration boards were not giving overriding predominance
to government fiscal policy and in some cases did not find it useful at
all.   Nevertheless, the complainant still fears potential abuse.   It
is this lack of confidence that obliges the Committee to recall again the
principle that adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration
procedures should be available in the event of the right to strike being
subject to limitations in the public or essential services.

	137.	In the present case, it appears to the Committee that the independence
of the arbitration boards set up to compensate public employees for the
loss of their right to strike (being composed of a representative of each
of the parties to the dispute plus a chairman jointly appointed by the
representatives) is not called into question by the listing in legislation
of factors to be taken into account.

	138.	As regards the eight other amendments to the Labour Relations Act
(one of which was copied in the Public Service Employee Relations Act)
contained in Bill 44, the Committee notes from the report of the representative
of the Director-General that many of these have not given rise to problems
in practice and that some have not even been utilised.   In particular,
the Committee sees no threat to freedom of association with the following
sections:

-
Section 1(w.1), introducing a new concept of "trade union organisation",
was never adopted;

-
Section 74(1), requiring a duly authorised representative for collective
bargaining to be resident in Alberta, may cause minor inconvenience to
the union but is in fact clearly intended to avoid delays in the final
settlement and signing of agreements.   It does not fetter a trade union's
right to seek assistance in bargaining from persons outside the province;

-
Section 87, allowing only one Board-supervised strike or lock-out vote,
restricts certain union tactics but does not prevent the polling of members
to determine the position prior to calling for a vote;

-
Section 49(1), requiring a 90-day moratorium before applying for a further
certification order, again affects union tactics but was clearly intended
to remove uncertainty as to a union's real strength in the bargaining unit
and to avoid abuses of certification proceedings;
-
Section 132, allowing application to the Board to determine successor
rights, only regulates and expedites normal past practice and is not unreasonable;

-
Section 102.2, empowering the recommendations of a Disputes Inquiry
Board to be put to the employees concerned, may raise the question of the
role of a union executive but does not deprive individual workers of their
trade union rights.

	139.	On the other hand, the Committee would express some concern over
two other individual amendments to the Labour Relations Act:

-
Sections 105 and 106, prohibiting the threat of an illegal strike, could
impede the freedom of workers' organisations to organise their activities
in full freedom and place trade union officials in some jeopardy, given
the broad definition of "strike" in the Act.   The Government told the
representative of the Director-General that section 105 had not been used
and that it would be up to the Board to highlight any difficulties with
its drafting if and when called to apply this provision.  The Committee
considers that the uncertainty and imprecision of the definition of a "strike"
could, as the representative of the Director-General suggested, lead to
difficulties for trade unionists who take bona fide action that is subsequently
found to be illegal.   The Committee would request the Government to take
steps to clarify the situation in consultation with the unions and, if
necessary, amend the provision accordingly.

-
Section 117.94 (and section 92.2 of the Public Service Employee Relations
Act), allowing the employer to suspend check-offs if an illegal strike
takes place, have not been used.   The precise scope of the provision is,
however, uncertain in the sense that it is not clear whether the suspension
would apply to a whole bargaining unit or only to the illegal strikers.
Discussion should take place with the unions to clarify the manner in
which the provision would be applied in practice.

The Committee's recommendations

	140.	In these circumstances, the Committe recommends the Governing Body
to approve this part of the report and, in particular, the following conclusions:

(a)
The Committee considers that the provisions of the Public Service Employee
Relations Act and the Labour Relations Act prohibiting the right to strike
of a broad range of provincial public servants and hospital workers go
beyond acceptable limits on the right to strike recognised as deriving
from Article  3 of Convention No. 87.   The Committee requests the Government
to re-examine the provisions in question in order to confine the ban
on
strikes to services which are essential in the strict sense of the term.
(b)
As regards the broad range of public servants excluded from the collective
bargaining process by section 21(1) of the Public Service Employee Relations
Act, the Committee would draw the Government's attention to the principle
that only civil servants engaged in the administration of the State may
be so excluded.   It requests the Government to reconsider this section
in the light of this principle.

(c)
Although the Committee does not consider that the listing of government
fiscal policies as a factor to be considered by arbitrators calls into
question the principles of freedom of association, it notes with some concern
the power given to the Public Service Employee Relations Board (by section
48(2) of the relevant Act) to determine all matters in a collective dispute
that may be referred to arbitration.   The Committee hopes that provisions
such as these which have undermined the union's confidence in the arbitration
system - which is meant to compensate the employees concerned for the lack
of the right to strike - will be reconsidered in consultation with the
parties and appropriate amendments made with a view to enabling arbitrators
to examine all matters in dispute.

(d)
The Committee sees no threat to freedom of association with the various
amendments to the Labour Relations Act contained in Bill 44 and outlined
in paragraph 138 above, i.e. section 74(1), section 87, section 49(1),
section 132 and section 102.2.

(e)
As regards sections 105 and 106 of the Labour Relations Act, as amended,
prohibiting the threat of an illegal strike, the Committee requests the
Government to take steps to clarify the precise scope of this provision
in consultation with the union and, if necessary, amend the provision accordingly;

(f)
As regards section 117.94 of the Labour Relations Act and section 92(2)
of the Public Service Employee Relations Act, concerning the suspension
of check-off in the event of an illegal strike, the Committee recommends
that discussion takes place with the unions in order to clarify the manner
in which this provision would be applied in practice.

D.
The Committee's conclusions on Case No. 1260/Newfoundland

	141.	The Committee notes all the detailed information supplied by the
complainants in this case, the equally detailed information transmitted
by the Government and the information contained in the report of the representative
of the Director-General.

	142.	In essence, the complainants had alleged that the Public Service
(Collective Bargaining) Act - known as Bill 59 - which came into effect
on 1 September 1983, was in contradiction with international standards
on freedom of association in three particular areas:  the definition of
"employee" contained in section 2(1)(i) of the Act;  the designation of
"essential employees" (section 10) and the limitation on strike action
(sections 10, 23 and 24).

	143.	Before examining these individual aspects, the Committee would first
note the information now at its disposal concerning the introduction of
the legislation in question.   It can only express regret that, in spite
of what appears to have been a good relationship between the complainant
union and the Government, the process of consultation with the union prior
to the introduction of Bill 59 was inadequate.   The attitudes of both
parties were to an extent the reason for this inadequacy.   The Government,
for its part, had what it considered to be solid reasons, based on experience,
for amending existing legislation, whereas the union was opposed to such
a course of action.   The result was an enactment which, in the opinion
of the union, casts suspicion on the Government's real motives in proclaiming
it.   It was also an enactment which, had proper consultations taken place,
may well have taken a different form and thereby avoided the tension and
suspicion that obviously exists between the union and the Government.
The Committee, in particular, notes that only two years after the enactment
of Bill 59, important amendments were made in 1985.

	144.	The Committee would emphasise the importance which should be attached
to full and frank consultation taking place on any questions or proposed
legislation affecting trade union rights.   It would express the firm hope
that the Government and the union will, in the light of the problems which
have emerged from the procedure used to introduce Bill 59, engage in systematic
and genuine discussions and negotiations with a view to resolving the problems
that have arisen in the present case.

	145.	As regards section 2(1)(i)(xii) of Bill 59 (definition of "employee"),
the union's principal concern was the exclusion from the definition of
persons employed in an employment opportunity programme administered and
financed by the Provincial Government, and/or financed by the federal Government.
According to the union, not only did the provisions prevent such persons
from joining a union, but the presence of this non-unionised labour in
workplaces where the union had members, constituted an obstacle to collective
bargaining and a threat to union effectiveness in the event, for example,
of a strike.

	146.	On this question, the Committee notes that there seemed to be a considerable
amount of misunderstanding between the parties as to the precise number
of persons covered by this subsection.   Whatever the case, the Committee
cannot accept that persons engaged in an employment opportunity programme
should be excluded from the right to belong to a trade union of their choice.
The Committee considers that the extension of the right to organise of
these persons would not necessarily interfere with the proper functioning
of the programme and
that, in addition, it would diminish the fear of the
union that unionised workers might be replaced by workers engaged under
the programme.

	147.	A further exclusion from the definition of "employee" is the category
of workers who advises the employer in relation to the development or administration
of policies or programmes (section 2(1)(i)(xv).   The Committee notes that
the Labour Relations Board, tripartite in character, appears in the past
to have exercised its powers fairly restrictively in deciding exclusions
from the bargaining unit.   It considers that this subsection is not contrary
to the principles of freedom of association.

	148.	In view of the problems and the climate of suspicion to which the
above provisions in Bill 59 have given rise, the Committee would urge the
Government to reconsider the question of exclusions in full consultation
with the union.

	149.	The Committee notes that the right to strike is available to public
service employees in Newfoundland subject to a number of limitations concerning,
in particular, employees deemed to be essential.   Essential employees
are defined in the principal Act as "employees whose duties consist in
whole or in part of duties, the performance of which at any particular
time or during any specified period of time is, or may be, necessary for
the health, safety or security of the public" (section 10.1).

	150.	In this connection, the Committee would, in the first place, recall
that it has accepted that the right to strike may be limited or prohibited
as regards public servants acting in their capacity as agents of the public
authority or engaged in services whose interruption would endanger the
life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the propulation.
Such limitations or prohibitions should, however be offset by adequate,
impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures.   In addition,
the Committee observes that the 1985 amendments to the legislation exclude
a substantial number of bargaining units from the application of section
10 of the Act.   The Government had also agreed with the union in writing
that no essential services would be sought in some ten bargaining units.

	151.	The problem in Newfoundland is that, although strikes can take place
even in services such as health-care institutions, the strike may be rendered
ineffectual as a result of the procedure for the designation of a certain
number of "essential workers".   In addition, recourse to arbitration may
be impeded if the number so designated by the Labour Relations Board falls
below 50 per cent of the employees involved.   In other words, it would
seem in such circumstances that the limitations placed on unions to carry
out an effective strike are not adequately compensated by unimpeded access
to arbitration machinery.

	152.	The Committee considers that, while the method of designating essential
employees is not inconsistent with the principles of freedom of association,
the Government should nevertheless review the relevant provision in such
a manner as to facilitate access to independent arbitration in the event
of a dispute.

	153.	Further amendments introduced to the principal Act by Bill 59 affecting
the right to strike were also criticised by the union.   Section 2 of Bill
59 repealed and substituted section 10 of the principal Act in such a manner
as to prevent a bargaining agent from taking a strike vote or going on
strike until agreement has been reached on or the Board has determined
the number of essential employees in the unit concerned.   Moreover, amendments
to section 23 and 24 of the Act made it necessary not only to give seven
days' notice of a strike but also to indicate the date on which the strike
would start.   If the strike did not start on the date specified in the
notice, no strike could take place for one month, and then only if a further
seven days' notice was given with a further proposed date on which the
strike would commence.   These amendments also prevented strikes on a rotating
basis in health service institutions.

	154.	As regards these amendments and the allegations that were made, the
Committee does not consider the modalities that they impose to be an undue
hindrance on unions in the exercise of their right to strike and thereby
going beyond what is acceptable under international standards and principles
on freedom of association.   The Committee also notes, in particular, that
the further amendments introduced in July 1985, the one-month period referred
to above, now only applies to the hospital sector.   The Committee, however,
notes from the report of the representative of the Director-General that
these limitations are seen by the unions as an interference by the Government
in the determination of strike tactics and, in particular, that the notice
requirement could be used to delay strikes by last-minute bargaining.
The Committee observes that there is no evidence that these fears are
justified, particularly in view of the Government's statement that the
parties could always agree to extend the seven-day notice period by one
day if necessary.   This is yet another matter which the Committee considers
could be jointly discussed between the parties with a view to removing
the doubts and suspicions that remain as to the manner in which the legislation
will be applied.

The Committee's recommendations

	155.	The Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this part
of the report and, in particular, the following conclusions:

(a)
The Committee emphasises the importance which should be attached to
full and frank consultations taking place with the trade unions on any
questions or proposed legislation affecting trade union rights;  it expresses
regret that consultation with the
complainant union prior to the enactment
of Bill 59 was inadequate.

(b)
The Committee considers that persons engaged in employment opportunity
programmes should not be excluded from the right to belong to a union of
their choice;  it urges the Government to reconsider the question of the
exclusion of this category in full consultation with the union.

(c)
The Committe emphasises that limitations on strike action in the public
service or in essential services should be compensated by adequate, impartial
and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties
can take part at every stage and in which the awards should, in all cases,
be binding on both parties.

(d)
The Committee requests the Government to review the provisions of the
legislation concerning the designation of essential employees in order
to facilitate access to independent arbitration in the event of a dispute.

(e)
The Committee does not consider the modalities for strike action imposed
by sections 23 and 24 of Bill 59, as amended, to be inconsistent with the
principles of freedom of association.

(f)
The Committee expresses the firm hope that the Government and the union
will, in the light of the problems which have emerged from the enactment
of Bill 59, engage in systematic and genuine discussions and negotiations
with a view to resolving the problems that remain concerning the practical
application of this legislation.

I.  Introduction

	1.	The Governing Body Committee on Freedom of Association, at its meeting
in November 1984, decided to postpone its examination of the cases concerning
Ontario, Alberta and Newfoundland since it was of the view that, before
reaching conclusions in these cases, it would be necessary to obtain additional
information, particularly through a study and information mission, which
could assist in clarifying aspects of the laws and practices involved.
The Committee accordingly requested the Government to indicate its consent
to such a procedure.

	2.	In a letter dated 1 February 1985 the Government indicated that, after
consultation with the various provincial governments concerned, it had
no objection to such a mission taking place.

	3.	The Committee explained that the study and information mission would
take place within the context of its examination of the cases.   It emphasised
that its proposal for such a mission stemmed from a desire on its part
to reach conclusions in as full a knowledge and understanding as possible
of the complex issues involved.   It said that it was convinced that its
work would be greatly facilitated by an on-the-spot appreciation of the
day-to-day practical operation, in local conditions, of the legislation
that was the subject of the complaints.

	4.	Arrangements were accordingly made for a study and information mission
to take place in Canada - in particular, the provinces of Ontario, Alberta
and Newfoundland - from 12 to 25 September 1985.   The Director-General
of the ILO appointed me as his representative to carry out the mission,
and I was accompanied, during the mission, by Mr. William R. Simpson, Chief
of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards
Department, and Mrs. Jane Hodges, an official of the Freedom of Association
Branch.

	5.	Through the efficient services of the officials of the Canadian Ministry
of Labour responsible for these matters, and the equally efficient services
of the officials of the Canadian Labour Congress, arrangements were made
to establish a programme of meetings with representatives of the federal
Government and those of the provincial governments involved and with the
various national and provincial unions who had been involved in the submission
of the complaints (for a detailed list of the persons involved, see Annex).
It is also thanks to the facilities that were extended to me by the governments
and unions of the provinces of Ontario, Alberta and Newfoundland that I
was able to carry out successfully the mandate that had been entrusted
to me.

	6.	Prior to my departure to Canada I had had the opportunity to examine
the complaints that had been presented in these cases, the various replies
of the respective governments and the very voluminous documentation and
legislative texts which had accompanied the many communications addressed
to the ILO.  In preparing this report I found it appropriate in the first
place, to describe in some detail the main issues raised by the complainants
in their written allegations as well as the respective goverments' arguments
in rebuttal of those allegations.   The information which I was able to
collect during the mission concerning these matters is then described.
I have attempted thus to provide the Committee on Freedom of Association
with a report that gives as complete a picture as possible of the situation
from the time the complaints were presented until the present time.   I
am hopeful that, in presenting my report in this manner, I have been successful
in facilitating the work of the Committee in reaching its conclusions in
these cases.

	7.	I would emphasise that it was at no time my intention or desire - nor
indeed was it part of my mandate - to formulate any conclusions on the
various issues that I was called upon to examine.   That responsibility
rests exclusively with the Committee on Freedom of
Association itself.
I did, however, carry out this mission having in mind the international
standards and principles concerning freedom of association, the application
of which had been brought into question by the complainant organisations
and I have not hesitated in this report to set forth certain personal opinions
or impressions that I was able to form regarding possible breaches of international
obligations or regarding any remedial steps that might be taken if ILO
standards and principles did not seem to be fully applied.   In so doing,
my intention was not to prejudge the conclusions of the Committee, which
will no doubt attach to these opinions or impressions the weight which
it considers appropriate and correct.

II.
General remarks

	8.	It is not necessary for me to emphasise that the individual complaints
arise in three provinces of a federal State.   The structure and complexities
of such a constitutional arrangement will be well known to the Committee.
Although each issue has to be assessed in the confines of the individual
provincial context it is instructive to note that the problems have some
common aspects.   This is well known to the parties.   Indeed, on the trade
union side the influence of trade union centres inevitably leads to attention
being given to the general similarities of the issues.   It may be worth
while to draw attention to a few of these general points.   The purpose
is not to divert attention from the duty to treat each case indpendently
but to illustrate more clearly the underlying problems.

(a)
	Economic and political pressures

	9.	The legislation which lies at the heart of most of the complaints represents
an attempt by the government concerned to tackle perceived economic problems.
These problems have provoked a political response which in turn lends
shape to the objects and scope of the consequent legislation.   This is
very clearly the case with Bill 44 in Alberta and Bill 179 in Ontario.
Bill 59 in Newfoundland is less obviously concerned with economic problems
but the steps taken appear to flow, however indirectly, from such considerations.

	10.	There is, of course, a lively debate as to the depth, even as to the
existence, of economic problems.   Whatever view is taken on this it is
plain that the governments concerned were clear that the economic problems
demanded urgent attention usually described as an attack on inflation.
It is the impact of these legislative steps on the implementation of
ILO principles such as those enshrined in Conventions Nos. 87 and 98 that
lies at the core of these complaints.   The debate on the validity of economic
judgements lies elsewhere.
(b)
	Public sector

	11.	The complaints are raised by public service trade unions and concern
the impact of legislative measures on the collective bargaining arrangements
in the public sector.   One factor in the minds of the complainants is
that there is a lack of even handedness in the treatment of the public
as opposed to the private sector.   Such comparisons are not always easy
to make and anyway lie outside the concern of the Committee.   None the
less it is a feeling that has to be noted.

	12.	There is a crucial difficulty which is very obvious.   Collective
bargaining involves the concept of two parties, the employer and the trade
union, settling their mutual concern by discussion and negotiation.   Where
the employer is the government there is an added difficulty.   The Government
has the wider task of managing the economy and this will in particular
often involve the task of seeking to influence the level of settlements
in collective bargaining by fiscal and economic argument.   It is extremely
difficult for the Government to separate the two roles so as to equate
bargaining in the public sector with that in the private sector.

	13.	The usual way in which this separation is attempted is by the establishment
of a sound set of bargaining structures in the public sector.   These can
then operate in the normal way and the wider concerns of government, which
need not necessarily be the same in respect of public as opposed to private
employment but generally will be, can be imposed from outside the collective
bargaining machinery, for example by legislation.

(c)
	Collective bargaining machinery

	14.	It is difficult and dangerous to generalise about the structure of
collective bargaining which is constructed separately by each province,
as well as by the federal Government.   There are obviously so many variations
that cannot be properly assessed in a short study.   Consideration of the
formal statutory-based machinery does not necessarily give an accurate
picture of what actually happens in practice.   It is even more difficult
to assess the ability of structures to meet pressures which will inevitably
be encountered as a result of, for example, a recession or growth of unemployment.

	15.	Collective bargaining in Canada has been established at both the national
and provincial level since the 1960s, so does not have a long history.
Three differing aspects of the employer-employee relationship can be
distinguished.   Consultation is the process most difficult to assess since
it will often be to a large extent informal.   It follows that a study
of the processes laid down may fail to indicate the level of consultations
in practice.   Bargaining itself is likely to follow fairly closely the
rules laid down in the legislation setting it up and the practices developed
over the years by agreement between the parties.   Finally, and most elusive,
it is
hard to describe the impact of the power to legislate.   The use
of legislation of course lies to the hands of one of the parties, the employer.
The various ways in which it is used raise difficulties and appear to
lead to possible misunderstanding and bad feeling.

(d)
	Legislation

	16.	The complaints before the Committee arise from specific pieces of
legislation and their interpretation and application in practice.   The
next part of this report will take the form of a more detailed examination
of the specific issues raised against aspects of Bill 59 in Newfoundland,
Bill 44 in Alberta and Bill 179 in Ontario.

	17.	At this stage it is necessary to refer to a more general point.
It seems important to distinguish the objects of government legislation
and its impact.   In the context of this study it has been apparent that
two features of legislation should be given careful attention.

	18.	The scope of legislation varies.   It may be permanent or temporary.
It may affect the employment generally or apply to specific bargaining
relationships.   Its genesis may be the regulation of the economy on the
one hand or the control of the structure of bargaining procedures on the
other.   Often the two strands will be interwined and the purposes of the
legislation difficult to separate.

	19.	It appears, secondly, that it is possible to intervene more directly
in the collective bargaining process.   Steps can be taken to affect the
outcome of a particular bargain by recourse to one form of the legislative
processes.   Whereas the process alluded to in the last paragraph may be
regarded as strategic intervention, what is being described here is more
in the nature of tactical.

	20.	The standards secured by the Committee on Freedom of Association apply,
of course, with equal rigour to action, whatever its character.   Viewed
from the standpoint of trade unions concerned, it may be difficult to appreciate
these distinctions since all actions of the type that leads to a complaint
is obviously notable for its perceived deleterious effect.   The concerns
that this Committee have shown in the past, however, indicate that the
distinctions have a bearing on ILO deliberations.   Emergency legislation
even handedly applied to collective bargaining overall to meet a perceived
economic crisis is of a markedly different character to legislation aimed
at a particular section of employment or individual collective bargaining
process.  Here the process of collective bargaining, it must be stressed,
covers the totality of the steps available, including, it is important
to stresss, any access given to
independent
arbitration.

	21.	An attempt will be made in the next section to assist the Committee
with indications formulated with these analytical distinctions in mind.

III.  Case of Alberta - No. 1247

A.
Introduction

	22.	In this case the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) presented a complaint
of infringements of trade union rights in a communication dated 1 November
1983.   The complaint was presented on behalf of the Alberta Union of Provincial
Employees (AUPE), a component of the National Union of Provincial Government
Employees (NUPGE) which is the CLC's second largest affiliate.   The Government
transmitted its observations in a communication dated 3 May 1984.

B.
The issues

	23.	In its letter of 1 November 1983 the CLC alleged that new legislation
in Alberta violated Conventions Nos. 87, 98 and 151.   On 1 June 1983,
an Act to amend various pieces of labour legislation (the Labour Statutes
Amendment Act (known as Bill 44)) had been proclaimed.   According to the
CLC, Bill 44 was aimed at attacking in particular public sector workers
in Alberta.   One amendment denied the right to strike of thousands of
non-essential hospital workers, and another destroyed any degree of impartiality
in the arbitration system which had been intended to compensate public
sector workers for the loss of their right to strike.

(i)
	Exclusion of certain employees
	from collective bargaining

	24.	The complainant referred specifically to new section 21(1) of the
Public Service Employee Relations Act which reads as follows:

	A person employed by an employer in a position classified under the Public
Service Act as a budget officer, a systems analyst, an auditor, a disbursement
control officer or a hearing officer who hears matters under the Summary
Convictions Act, or performing for an employer substantially similar duties
to a person employed in any of those positions, [and] in any of the following:
the Legislative Assembly Office, the Office of the Auditor General, the
Office of the Chief Electoral Officer, or the Office of the Ombudsman or
who in the opinion of the [Public Service Employee Relations] Board should
not be included in a collective bargaining unit by reason of the duties
and responsibilities he has to his employer or for any other reason shall
not be included in a bargaining unit or in any other unit for collective
bargaining.
According to the complainant, this amendment had reversed a series of decisions
of the Public Service Employee Relations Board (one of which was unsuccessfully
challenged by the Government before the courts) to the effect that the
Government could not legitimately exclude certain groups of employees from
the right to engage in collective bargaining and be represented by a trade
union.

	25.	On this point the Government, in its communication of 3 May 1984,
explained that the legislative amendments with respect to section 21(g)
and (h) of the Public Service Employee Relations Act did not represent
a significant change in the policies originally contained in those subsections;
the exclusion of managerial and confidential employees, those involved
in the implementation of personnel-related programmes, those involved in
supporting the collective bargaining function, and those involved in the
operations of the Government financial control system, activities of the
Ombudsman, the courts and the Legislature itself had not been altered,
but further refined to reflect continuing alterations in the structure
of Government and the nature of employment in these cases.

(ii)
The arbitration system

	26.	The complainant stated that the amendments to section 117.8 of the
Labour Relations Act and section 55 of the Public Service Employee Relations
Act contained in Bill 44 showed the Government's lack of faith in the impartial
arbitrators who determine the wages and working conditions of many public
sector employees in Alberta in recent months.   According to the complainant,
rather than reassess the adequacy of cases presented to the arbitrators
by government representatives and rather than take direct political responsibility
for the imposition of wage controls, the Government had fettered the discretion
of arbitrators and imposed an informal system of controls.   The amendments,
which were identical, read as follows:

	To ensure that wages and benefits are fair and reasonable to the employees
and employer and are in the best interest of the public, the arbitration
board (a) shall consider, for the period with respect to which the award
will apply, the following:  wages and benefits in private and public and
unionised and non-unionised employment;  the continuity and stability of
private and public employment including employment levels and incidences
of lay-offs, incidences of employment at less than normal working hours,
and opportunity for employment;  any fiscal policies that may be declared
from time to time in writing by the Provincial Treasurer for the purposes
of this Act;  and (b) may consider, for the period with respect to which
the award will apply, the following:  the terms and conditions of employment
in similar occupations outside the employer's employment taking into account
any geographic, industrial or other variations that the board considers
relevant;  the need to maintain appropriate relationships in terms of conditions
of employment between different classification levels within an occupation
and between
occupations in the employer's employment;  the need to establish
terms and conditions of employment that are fair and reasonable in relation
to the qualifications required, the work performed, the responsibility
assumed and the nature of the services rendered;  any other factor that
it considers relevant to the matter in dispute.

	27.	According to the complainant, the foregoing provision required that
an arbitrator take into account government fiscal policy and thereby sought
to impose a system of informal wage restraint.   The complainant recalled
that in many cases dealing with the rights of employees in the civil service
and in essential services where the right to strike has been withdrawn
and a system of arbitration substituted, the Committee on Freedom of Association
had stressed the importance of impartiality.   The complainant claimed
that it was dishonourable for the Government to withdraw the right to strike
in these sectors and then impose a system of binding arbitration which
was not even apparently impartial.

	28.	To the allegation that section 117.8 of the Labour Relations Act and
section 55 of the Public Service Employee Relations Act unreasonably restricted
the freedom of arbitration boards and in so doing amounted to a disguised
form of wage controls, the Government had replied that amendments concerning
the nature of factors to be considered by a board did not, as alleged,
impose restrictions.   The criteria considered relevant to the decisions
were merely listed, including wages and benefits elsewhere in the provincial
labour market and the fiscal policies of the Government.   The Government
stated that the legislation did not stipulate how consideration of these
factors was to be employed in the decision-making process.   The shifting
relevancy of criteria over time was recognised to the extent that "any
other factor" might be considered, and given whatever weight was deemed
appropriate.   The comprehensive result of all listed factors was to give
unfettered discretion to a board as to the weight it would assign to any
particular criterion.   According to the Government, the factors listed
were evidentiary rather than substantive in nature.

(iii)
Other issues

	29.	The complainant further alleged that many of the amendments contained
in Bill 44 were designed to undermine the bargaining authority of trade
unions and thereby to impair free collective bargaining.   It cited in
particular section 74(1) of the Labour Relations Act which required that
every trade union appoint only persons residing in Alberta with authority
to bargaining collectively, conclude and sign a collective agreement.
That section reads as follows:

	On the service of a notice to commence collective bargaining by or on an
employer or trade union, the employer or trade union shall appoint a person
resident in Alberta with authority to
bargain collectively, to conclude
a collective agreement, and to sign a collective agreement on its behalf.
According to the complainant this requirement would seriously impair the
operation of those small local unions which relied on out-of-province business
agents associated with the national or international federations to conduct
collective bargaining.

	30.	In response to this allegation the Government pointed out that section
74 of the Labour Relations Act had been amended to require the parties
to collective bargaining to "appoint a person resident in Alberta".   The
Government explained that where trade union locals were part of a national
labour organisation, accessibility to someone with authority to sign and
conclude a collective agreement had been a problem in the past.   Under
the amendments to section 74, a small local union might still utilise out-of-province
business agents associated with a national or international network as
part of the bargaining committee and to act as a principal spokesman, but
someone resident in the province must have authority for the purpose of
facilitating the conduct of bargaining, including the conclusion of a collective
agreement.

	31.	The complainant referred to section 87 of the Labour Relations Act
which provided that only one strike or lock-out vote might be taken with
respect to a dispute.   This section reads as follows:

	During the open period, a bargaining agent may apply to the board to supervise
a strike vote or an employers' organisation may apply to the board to supervise
a lock-out vote.   Only one strike or lock-out vote may take place with
respect to a dispute.

According to the complainant this provision would prevent unions and employers'
associations from canvassing the opinions of their membership as to whether
a strike or lock-out should take place in any given set of circumstances;
the pro-strike or pro-lock-out vote would become a mere formality to be
obtained at the commencement of collective bargaining.   The complainant
stated there was no sound reason why the members of a bargaining unit should
not be free to change their mind as to whether to strike as circumstances
changed.

	32.	In relation to section 87 of the Labour Relations Act, the Government
stated that a strike or lock-out was the commencement of the economic contest
and therefore such votes were supervised by the Labour Relations Board
of Alberta.   The changes to section 87 did not prohibit a union from conducting
its own vote or canvassing the opinion of its membership as to whether
a strike should take place in any given set of circumstances.   Such a
vote, conducted by the union, was part of the internal administration of
the trade union and accordingly the provision did not interfere with a
private vote within the union.   The Government explained that such a vote
or canvassing was not in substitution of a vote supervised by the Labour
Relations Board which is a precondition for a lawful strike.   Moreover,
continued the Government, if the vote carried whether for strike or lock-out,
then one party or the other had chosen the economic forum as the means
of resolving the dispute.   The policy as represented by this provision
was that the members were free to strike, but should do so only when that
appeared the only means of resolving the dispute.   The alternative would
be to open the door to a series of strike votes.

	33.	According to the complainant, section 102.2(2) of the Labour Relations
Act as amended by Bill 44 empowered the Minister of Labour to require that
the members of a bargaining unit affected by the recommendations of a Disputes
Inquiry Board vote whether or not to accept the recommendations.   This
section reads as follows:

	Unless a party to the dispute notifies the [Labour Relations] Board of
its acceptance of the recommendations of the disputes inquiry board within
ten days after receiving a copy of the recommendations from the Minister,
the [Labour Relations] Board shall supervise a vote on the acceptance or
rejection of the recommendations by the employees or employers affected
by the dispute who are represented by that party.

According to the complainant this power amounted to unwarranted interference
in the internal affairs of a trade union which had the right and responsibility
to canvass its own members as to the acceptability of any particular settlement
proposal;  it believed that the conduct of labour relations ought to be
left to the parties and not to the Minister of Labour.

	34.	With regard to section 102.2(2) the Government stated that the amendments
to this section were aimed at recent situations in which a trade union
had refused to resolve a dispute notwithstanding that a majority of employees
in the unit had wished the dispute to be resolved under certain conditions.
According to the Government, this provision ensured that the wishes of
the majority in the unit might be expressed on the question of acceptance
of a board award.

	35.	The complainant alleged that sections 105 and 106 of the Labour Relations
Act created a new and dangerous offence by prohibiting persons acting on
behalf of trade unions or employers from threatening a strike or lock-out
in circumstances where a strike or lock-out would not be permitted under
the Act.   The sections read as follows:

	Section 105(3).   No employee, bargaining agent, or person acting on behalf
of a bargaining agent shall threaten to strike or to cause a strike unless
the strike is permitted by this Act.

	Section 106(3).   No employer shall threaten to lock-out unless the lock-out
is permitted by this Act.

The complainant pointed out that the question of whether a strike or lock-out
was illegal was a complicated one and the parties should not therefore
be prohibited from talking about it.   The complainant
questioned whether
it was the Government's intention to penalise employees under section 105
who, for example, refused to perform work which they believed to be unsafe.

	36.	With regard to the inclusion of "threats" to strike or lock-out in
sections 105 and 106 of the Labour Relations Act, the Government stated
that a strike or lock-out was not permitted where the preconditions as
set out in the Act had not been satisfied.   However, if a strike or lock-out
with its serious consequences upon employees and employers might only occur
when certain conditions had been satisfied then neither the trade union,
employees or persons acting on behalf of the trade union or the employer
should be able to threaten an illegal act to achieve other purposes, such
as threatening a strike to force an alteration of a collective agreement
during its term against the will of the other party.   In any case, the
Government pointed out that these provisions were being reconsidered primarily
because of evidentiary difficulties.   The Government added that it was
not the intention of this section to penalise workers who refused to perform
work which they believed was unsafe.   Questions of unsafe work were fully
addressed in legislation concerning health and safety.   According to the
Government, the essential element of a strike was that it was a concerted
refusal by two or more employees aimed at compelling an employer to accept
terms and conditions of employment;  the Labour Relations Board had never
interpreted a strike to include a refusal to work when conditions were
unsafe.

	37.	The complainant alleged that several provisions in Bill 44 were designed
to make it more difficult for trade unions to obtain and maintain certificates
enabling them to represent workers in collective bargaining.   It refered
in particular to section 49(1) of the Labour Relations Act which reads
as follows:

	Notwithstanding anything in this Act, if an application for certification
as a bargaining agent, revocation of the certification of a bargaining
agent, a declaration that a bargaining agent is no longer entitled to bargain
collectively, registration of employers' organisation or cancellation of
registration of an employers' organisation, has been refused by the Board
or withdrawn by the applicant, the applicant shall not, without the consent
of the Board, make the same or substantially the same application until
after the expiration of 90 days from the date of the withdrawal or refusal.

According to the complainant this section would prevent trade unions from
withdrawing applications for certification when they realised that there
was no majority support and resubmitting the application when a majority
had been obtained.   The only effect of this amendment would be to make
organisation campaigns more difficult and accordingly more expensive.

	38.	The Government explained that amendments to section 49 of the Labour
Relations Act required an applicant for certification to obtain board permission
to reapply before the expiry of 90 days from
the date of withdrawal or
refusal of a previous application.   It stated that these amendments had
been implemented in recognition of the administrative effects on the employer,
employees and the Labour Relations Board itself where repeated failed applications
are made.

	39.	The complainant further stated that before the introduction of section
132 of the Labour Relations Act, a trade union's certificate remained in
full force notwithstanding the sale or disposition of the business of an
employer and that the previous situation had aimed at preventing the employer
from selling or transferring his business to an allied operator in order
to get rid of a certified trade union.   According to the complainant,
the new situation (whereby the Labour Relations Board may, upon application
by any employer, trade union or person affected, determine what rights,
privileges and duties have been acquired or retained) provided an opportunity
to successor employers to frustrate the desires of employees who might
wish to continue being represented in collective bargaining by their previously
certified bargaining agents.

	40. 	As regards the amendments to section 132, the Government stated that
these were designed to prevent incongruous results.   Before the introduction
of these changes, if the Labour Relations Board had concluded that there
had been a sale, lease or transfer of a business or part of it, then automatically
the certificate and the collective agreement to which the vendor was party
applied to the purchaser.   The Government stated that the intention of
the provision as amended remained to that effect;  however if a question
arose under section 132, the Labour Relations Board might declare the certificates,
collective agreement or proceedings to be binding on the purchaser in contrast
to the former provision where the Board was required to so declare.   The
new provision allowed for conflicts to be resolved by the Labour Relations
Board by allowing the Board to amend the certificate or collective agreement
in question or even revoke it.   The Government stressed that the Board
had only been given power permissibly to resolve conflicts.

	41.	The complainant further alleged that new section 1(w.1) of the Labour
Statutes Amendment Act, creating the concept of a "trade union organisation",
would create a situation in which the national or provincial organisation
which had authority to bargain on behalf of local unions would be subjected
to the penalties prescribed in the Act for trade unions.   The Government
pointed out that the amendments proposed in section 1(w.1) had never been
adopted and did not form part of the Labour Relations Act.

	42.	The complainant referred to section 117.94 of the Labour Relations
Act - which was identical to new section 92.2 of the Public Service Employee
Relations Act - as the most pernicious example of anti-union legislation
in Bill 44.   According to the complainant, the clear intention of this
section was to cripple a union financially if its members went on a strike.
The section reads as follows:

(1)	If a strike of employees to which this Division applies [i.e. public
employees who are prohibited from striking] commences, the employer, notwithstanding
any collective agreement or any other provision of this Act, may serve
the bargaining agent that represents those employees with a notice of intention
to suspend the deduction and remittance of union dues, assessments and
other fees payable to the bargaining agent.   (2) A notice of intention
shall specify the bargaining unit or part of the bargaining unit with respect
to which the employer intends to suspend the deduction and remittance of
union dues or other fees and a time period of not less than one month and
not more than six months with respect to which the employer intends the
suspension to be in effect.   (3) A bargaining agent affected by the notice
may apply to the board within 72 hours of service ... for a determination
as to whether or not a strike has occurred.

	43.	As regards section 117.94 of the Labour Relations Act and section
92.2 of the Public Service Employee Relations Act as amended by Bill 44,
the Government stated that, unless the union committed an illegal act,
the forwarding of union dues continued.   It added that, if the employer
served notice that union dues were to be withheld, an expeditious and inexpensive
appeal to the appropriate quasi-judicial Board was available and the Board
would decide whether a break in collection and remittance should occur
based on evidence that the union had or had not contravened the Act in
question and illegally interrupted the employer's operations.   Adequate
and appropriate appeal provisions existed to protect the interests of all
parties.

	44.	With regard to the withdrawal of the right to strike from hospital
workers contained in section 117.1 of the Labour Relations Act, the complainant
alleged that all hospital workers, including kitchen help, janitors, gardeners,
registered nurses, health service technicians and clerical staff, were
covered by this new section.

	45.	The Government stated its position as regards the international standards
relevant to the question, namely that freedom to associate was protected
but specific association objectives and dispute resolution mechanisms were
not.   It pointed out that the evolutionary nature of labour relations
precluded commitment to a single universal approach to dispute resolution.
The objects of association within the context of labour relations, principally
the protection of the interests of the workers, could be and were achieved
without utilisation of the strike mechanism.   According to the Government,
public sector collective bargaining must be approached within the larger
framework of the governing process itself of which it was but one part.
A number of extremely important characteristics had to be recognised
in the design of the collective bargaining system intended to be compatible
with it:  the governing process in Canada was one in which decisions were
reached by compromise and response to pressures brought to bear;  those
interests which influenced the distribution of scarce resources were involved
in a political process and must therefore be subject to the contraints
normally associated with such participation;  in order to maintain the
essential and
delicate balance within this process, particularly with respect
to essential administrative decision-making outside the normal review and
evaluation associated with the electoral process, no single interest could
be allowed to place other interests at a disadvantage.   The Government
also pointed out that while the nature of the work performed by public
service employees was often unique in most ways, the unique nature of the
employer remained constant, in that the Government was subject to scrutiny.
Lastly, the Government stated that continuance of the right to withhold
services by health care workers would place these interests at an unacceptable
advantage and priority over those whose legitimate health care needs must
be met by the system, for which there was no acceptable alternative, and
as such would compromise the decision-making process relating to the provision
of health care.   This situation had been altered only to the extent that
an alternative to the withdrawal of services had been provided and the
Government considered that this was an effective compromise which would
permit proper representation of employee interests within a framework that
complied with international standards.

C.
Information obtained during the mission

	46.	In the course of the mission I had the opportunity of discussing the
various issues involved in this case;  first, in Ottawa, with representatives
of the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) and the National Union of Provincial
Government Employees (NUPGE), and secondly, in Edmonton, with representatives
of the Alberta Union of Public Employees (AUPE) and its component divisions.
Discussions were also held with the Assistant Deputy Minister of Labour
and other provincial government officials.   In addition to the oral submissions
that were made by the parties, voluminous documentary evidence was communicated
to me in support of the arguments put forward by them.

	47.	From all these discussions it was clear that the three main issues
causing concern to the unions as a result of the enactment of Bill 44,
which amended both the Public Service Employee Relations Act of 1980 and
the Labour Relations Act, were the curtailment of collective bargaining
rights for public-sector employees and the manner in which the arbitration
procedures functioned, the further restrictions that Bill 44 placed on
the right to strike of public employees and the exclusion of certain employees
from the bargaining unit.   Several other issues, which also formed part
of the complaint, were also examined in detail and will be dealt with later.

(a)
	Collective bargaining and arbitration

	48.	The claim of the unions was that the introduction of Bill 44 had been
a clear and deliberate attempt to place further restrictions on the collective
bargaining rights of provincial government employees.   In addition, the
result of Bill 44 had been to destroy
any credibility in the fairness and
impartiality of the arbitration system, the only dispute-settlement mechanism
available to this category of workers.

	49.	Much information was obtained concerning the manner in which collective
bargaining takes place between the Alberta Union of Public Employees, as
the certified bargaining agent covering 12 separate divisions of public
employees (approximately 38,000 employees), and the Crown in the Right
of Alberta, as employer.   Under section 50 of the Public Service Employee
Relations Act, in the event of a dispute arising, if the the Public Service
Employee Relations Board is satisfied that the parties to the dispute have
failed to make reasonable efforts to conclude a collective agreement, the
Board may direct the parties to continue collective bargaining.   Section
51(1)(c) of the Act permits the Board to establish an arbitration board
if it is satisfied that not only are there additional items  which should
be referred to arbitration but also that it is the appropriate time to
refer the matter to an arbitration board.

	50.	At the time the mission took place collective agreements had been
concluded in respect of eight out of the 12 divisions of the AUPE;  the
four groups in respect of which no agreement had been reached being nurses,
economic staff, social workers and teachers.

	51.	The chief negotiator for the AUPE explained that Bill 44 had been
enacted following the discontent of the Government at the awards granted
by 12 separate arbitration boards in 1983.   These arbitrations had been
preceded by a decision of the Public Service Employee Relations Board that
there had been a failure on the part of the employers to bargain in good
faith.   The current round of negotiations, commenced in January 1984 for
the biennium 1984-85, had taken place in the context of the new  atmosphere
created by the enactment of Bill 44 and the employers demonstrated an aggressive
attitude at the bargaining table.   The failure of negotiations led to
a request being made in April 1984 by the union for arbitration but this
was rejected by the Board.   In July 1984, following the failure of mediation,
the Board referred the main, or master agreement, to arbitration.

	52.	Evidence was also submitted concerning the negotiating process which
the unions claimed was frustrating and time-consuming.   The Public Service
Employee Relations Board often served to delay or prevent references to
arbitration.   In one case involving some 14,000 administrative and clerical
workers, negotiations had commenced in January 1984;  the Board had, on
no fewer than three occasions, rejected an application for arbitration
on the grounds that it was "untimely and inappropriate".  This was followed
by an application to the court which, in March 1985, upheld the Board's
discretionary power to establish an arbitration board and stated that
the Board's decision in the present case was not "patently unreasonable".
It was only after the lapse of at least 18 months from the commencement
of negotiations that arbitration was obtained and, as the unions pointed
out, the question of retroactivity of wage increases was itself a matter
of negotiation.

	53.	More specifically, as regards the arbitration process, the unions
expressed considerable concern over the practical application of section
48(2) of the Public Service Employee Relations Act which limits the subject-matters
that may be referred for arbitration.   The Public Service Employee Relations
Board has jurisdiction to determine whether any particular claim falls
within the list of non-arbitral items set out in this provision.   In the
view of the unions this provision conferred upon the employer the unilateral
right to determine terms and conditions of employment.   They claimed that
all matters covered by this provision should fall within the scope of bargaining
and arbitration since they did not entirely concern questions of management
prerogative.

	54.	Examples of matters that had not been considered arbitral by virtue
of section 48 included the right of an employer to contract out work of
the bargaining unit, questions concerning hours of work and shift work,
certain leave periods and the calculation of overtime (section 48(2a));
questions of job evaluation, creation of job descriptions, questions of
equal pay for work of equal value (section 48(2b));  selection, transfer,
promotion, training, the provision of training in the safer operation of
equipment, etc. (section 48(2c)).   In a recent case (December 1984) the
Public Service Employee Relations Board had determined that a union's proposal
to protect the positions of laid-off employees by requiring an employer
to give notice of intended lay-offs was non-arbitral because it limited
employer discretion.   The unions, accordingly, claimed that these examples
showed that the Board gave a broad interpretation of section 48(2) in order
to protect the managerial prerogative of the employer.

	55.	Furthermore, the unions claimed that, even where items in dispute
were referred to arbitration, the discretion of arbitrators was curtailed
by the requirement that they take certain matters into consideration.
These criteria are set out in section 55 of the Act, and in particular,
oblige arbitrators to give special consideration to statements of government
fiscal policy.   In the unions' view, these provisions were introduced
in 1983 in response to the series of arbitration awards which the Government
had criticised as being too generous.   Some recent statements of fiscal
policy issued by the Government were made available to the mission.   According
to the unions, arbitrators were  required to promote government fiscal
policy and, accordingly, the results of arbitration were a reflection of
that policy.   In other words, such control of arbitral decision-making
meant that the Government was, in fact, legislating results for itself
as employer.  Arbitrators were thus prevented from exercising the degree
of independence that was necessary to constitute an adequate substitute
for collective bargaining.

	56.	In this connection, a number of recent arbitration awards were made
available to the mission.   From these it was clear that the arbitration
boards involved had given careful considerations to the
provisions of section
55(a) and (b) and had explored at length the conflicting roles of government
as the determiner of provincial labour fiscal policy, and as employer.
In some cases, the board had, in fact, not considered it necessary to
take account of the optional provisions contained in section 55(b) of the
Act.   In one case, in May 1984, the arbitration board had stated that
it did not find the government fiscal policy useful since, inter alia,
it did not prescribe the exact amount of the increase.

(b)
	Excluded employees

	57.	The mission also heard evidence concerning the exclusion, by virtue
of section 21(1) of the Act, of certain categories of employees from the
bargaining unit for the purpose of collective bargaining.   The recent
amendments under Bill 44 had broadened the range of persons denied the
right to engage in collective bargaining.   Some of these categories had
previously enjoyed this right.   It was recalled that section 21 substantially
provides that persons employed who have or exercise management responsibilites
or duties or who are primarily engaged in the administration of personnel
policies or pesonnel programmes, shall not be included in any bargaining
unit.

	58.	In the view of the unions, the exclusion of such employees was not
justified and the amendment, under Bill 44, had removed the right to collectively
bargain from a number of groups of employees who had been granted that
right by the Public Service Employee Relations Board under the previous
statute.   The Governmment had used its legislative authority to reverse
a series of decisions of the Board.   For example, the Board, in one case,
had held that employees in occupational health and safety programmes and
organisational development programmes and activities were not within the
scope of "personnel policies or programmes" defined in section 21(1)(b)
of the Act.   The Board, in its decision, had stated that personnel, in
the sense described, encompassed policies or programmes concerning the
recruitment of candidates, the hiring, the appointment and promotion of
employees, or the classification, evaluation, discipline or discharge of
employees.   The unions submitted further examples of cases in which the
amendments of Bill 44 denied the right to belong to a bargainging unit
to groups of workers, or individual officers, to whom that right had been
recognised by the Board.   According to the unions, over 400 persons had
been denied the right to collective bargaining by the amendments to section
21.

(c)
	The right to strike

	59.	The mission also heard submissions from the unions concerning the
overall denial of the right to strike imposed by section 93 of the Public
Service Employee Relations Act on those employees to whom the Act applies.
According to the unions, the Government had sought to justify this denial
by stating that, although all the employees concerned did not provide essential
services, they
were so closely linked to those providing essential services
as to make it reasonable that they should be treated in the same way;
that there was no alternative supply for these services;  and that these
employees were in a special position to place more pressure on the Government
than other citizens.

	60.	The unions claimed that there was no evidence of close links between
essential and non-essential persons and, more importantly, that the withdrawal
of labour by non-essential persons would not adversely affect the provision
of essential services.   Nor was there any evidence that there was no alternative
source of supply for the services provided by the employees affected.
Moroever, the unions stated, the same rationale had not been applied in
the private sector in cases where no alternative source of supply for many
services was available.

	61.	At meetings with representatives of the provincial Government of Alberta,
the issues that had been brought to the attention of the ILO and discussed
with the mission, were explained in detail.   The government representatives
explained to the mission that the response by the private sector to the
dramatic decline in the economy had been constructive, and the claims of
the public-sector unions that they were being selected for special, unfavourable
treatment were unique to that category of workers.

	62.	As regards the collective bargaining process, the government representatives
explained that either party had the right to veto matters that were suggested
for reference to arbitration.   Those which the Public Service Employee
Relations Board had excluded from those parts of the master agreement with
AUPE in respect of which arbitration had been sought concerned exclusively
management rights.   The Government conceded, however, that the definition
of management rights was a complex question.

	63.	In this connection, I suggested to the government representatives
that the Public Service Employee Relations Board, by refusing to consider
certain specific issues as arbitral, was itself arbitrating on these issues.
Where arbitration was fundamental in a non-strike situation, it seemed
anomalous that the Board, which was a procedural body, should be seen itself
to be acting as arbitrator on certain issues.   Such a procedure was certain
to destroy the unions' faith and confidence in the Board.   I further indicated
that it seemed that the Government's use of the legislative process to
deal with collective bargaining had also led to a loss of confidence by
unions in the bargaining system.

	64.	As regards arbitration itself, the government representatives indicated
that, from the limited experience that the Government had of arbitration
of interest disputes, there had been no evidence of misuse of the provision
(section 55 of the Act) requiring arbitrators to take account of provincial
fiscal policy.   There was no way of knowing what attention arbitrators
paid to the section, but,
in any event, the fiscal policy provided wide
scope for arbitrators.   Examples of government fiscal policy were given
to the mission.

	65.	On the question of exclusions under section 21(1) of the Act, as amended,
the Government explained that 260 employees in all were affected by the
amendment.   These were mainly involved in the personnel policy area and
only about 12 in the field of safety and health had been excluded from
the bargaining unit.

	66.	Concerning the denial of the right to strike, I informed the Government
generally that the Committee on Freedom of Association was likely to express
some concern about the provisions in the legislation on this matter in
the light of its stated principles.   The government representatives took
note of this and informed me that certain issues concerning the right to
strike for public employees were presently before the court.

	67.	I also brought to the attention of the Government the question, also
a concern of the unions, of the lack of prior consultation with the unions
on legislation concerning matters affecting them or their members.   In
response, the government representative informed me that any failure to
consult on such matters would be caused by the emergency of the situation
and not from any systematic policy not to consult.  Even on issues that
were urgent, public hearings would take place in Parliament, but normally
legislation was the result of lengthy and constructive discussions with
any parties that would be affected.

(d)
	Other issues

	68.	During discusssions with the AUPE, I was informed that, although that
organisation had initially feared that the use of experienced out-of-province
negotiators might have been restricted by section 74(1), the provision
as it stood was not a problem.   The provincial government representatives
explained that this provision had been introduced solely to deal with the
practical difficulties which had arisen in the past, when out-of-province
negotiators had not been able to be contacted during negotiations or, even
at the time of settlement, for signature of an agrement.   Given that there
appeared to be no serious problem with section 74(1) in practice, I expressed
my hope that the parties would be able to discuss its application if, in
the future, any problems might arise in this respect.

	69.	It was explained to the mission that section 87 of the Labour Relations
Act (providing for only one strike or lock-out vote with respect to a dispute)
had been introduced in reaction to a strike in 1982 by nurses at the Banff
Mineral Springs Hospital during which one of the trade unions involved
had disputed the results of a pro-strike vote.   The Government also pointed
out that, under this provision, the unions could meet and discuss possible
strike action as often as they wished, but could only apply for one strike
vote
supervised by the Labour Relations Board.   Both sides agreed that
there appeared to be no problem with the present situation in practice.

	70.	It was explained to the mission, in relation to section 102.2(2) (providing
for a Labour Relations Board supervised vote on the acceptance by employees
of a settlement in a dispute) that the Disputes Inquiry Board was a form
of binding mediation set up to examine particular disputes.   The provision
addressed the question as to whether union executives were free to accept
awards or whether individual union members should decide this at a vote
and it has not been used as yet.

	71.	During discussions with the union representatives, it was made clear
to the mission that the effect of section 105(3)'s introduction of an offence
for the mere threat of illegal strike action had added to their fears as
to the real purpose behind Bill 44.   They stressed that the danger of
this provision was compounded by the fact that the strike action had been
broadly defined in the legislation.   The Government, on the other hand,
pointed out that there were many Labour Relations Board decisions which
clarified the definition of strikes.   It also stressed that this provision
stemmed from the principle of fair collective bargaining in that the threat
of illegal action did not contribute to the resolution of a particular
bargaining issue or negotiations in general.   I pointed out that "persons
acting on behalf of the bargaining agent" were also covered by this broad
provision.   The Government explained that section 105(3) had not been
used and that it would be up to the Labour Relations Board, when faced
with the application of this provision, to highlight any drafting difficulties
regarding the position of union agents.

	72.	As regards the allegation relating to section 49 (introducing a 90-day
delay before the filing of further certification applications) of the Labour
Relations Act, it was explained to the mission that, under the Labour Relations
Act, the Labour Relations Board was empowered to grant a collective bargaining
certificate in three sets of circumstances:  firstly, when satisfied that
a majority of employees in the unit were paid-up union members having selected
the trade union to be their bargaining agent;  or secondly, when satisfied
that a majority of employees in the unit had applied for union membership
and paid a fee (or "deposit") not longer than 90 days before the date of
the application for certification, or thirdly, after conducting a vote.
Before the amendment only 30 days had applied to fee-paying employees.
The union representatives felt that this time extension was yet another
example of the real intent of Bill 44.   The Government explained that
section 49 was aimed at situations where there was not a constant organising
drive by trade unions for the purposes of collective bargaining certification.
This amendment had been introduced to remove any uncertainty as to a
union's real strength in the bargaining unit and to avoid the possible
abuse of certification proceedings as, for example, a defence to organising
drives by other unions in the same bargaining unit.   The Govenment pointed
out that since this amendment there had been no evidence of
its impact
on a trade union's ability to organise and apply for certification.   Since
a union's own constitution would set out the time limit for the lapse of
fee-paying applicants' membership, any procedural problem that section
49 might raise for unions could possibly be avoided by simple amendment
of their constitutions.   In addition, it was pointed out that the Labour
Relations Board had the discretion to conduct a vote even if a majority
(51 per cent) of employees in the bargaining unit had indicated its selection
of a trade union as its bargaining agent.

	73.	The union representatives told me that the amendment to section 132
concerning successor rights had no labour relations rationale.   The Government
explained that the amendment was a reaction to a court decision which had
interpreted the previous provision too broadly, thus enabling successor
rights to bind employees in "other related activities";  the position on
successor rights was now clarified in the Act and the Labour Relations
Board only had a discretion, not an obligation, to determine what rights,
privileges and duties carried on where a question arose under the provision.

	74.	From information obtained during the mission concerning section 117.94
of the Labour Relations Act and section 92.2 of the Public Service Employee
Relations Act concerning withdrawal of the check-off, it was clear that
the complainant's initial allegations related to a draft provision which
had not provided for notice and the right to appeal to the appropriate
board.   The union representatives acknowledged that there was no problem
at the moment with sections 117.94 and 92.2 as drafted and currently in
force since they had not been utilised.   The Government stressed the fairness
of the notice, appeal and time limit aspects of the present section;  it
nevertheless acknowledged that the possibility existed for an employer
to suspend all employee check offs in a situation where only one employee
had withdrawn his services.   It considered that in such cases the appropriate
board would have to decide whether an illegal strike had taken place and,
if not, order the employer not to go ahead with suspension of the check-off.

	75.	During discussions on the withdrawal of the right to strike from hospital
workers (section 117.1 of the Labour Relations Act), the AUPE representatives
emphasised their concern over the indiscriminate nature of section 117.1
in that non-essential staff were covered by the strike ban.   This has
been discussed in a more general context in some detail above.   Evidence
was put forward from hospital clerical staff to the effect that their job
description and duties did not differ from clerical work carried on outside
the hospital system and could not be described as essential.   The Government
pointed out that there was much uncertainty, both at the national and international
levels, as to what was an "essential service".   It was explained that
the Provincial Government decided to clarify the situation through legislation
rather than through Labour Relations Board decisions or arbitration decisions.
The Government stressed that only small groups were affected by section
117.1.  After it was pointed out to
the Government that in some specific
cases the international bodies had been very clear in defining the concept
of essential services, the question of possible abuse was raised.   The
Government explained that this question was before the courts in two jurisdictions,
namely the appeal of an Alberta Court of Appeal decision to the Canadian
Supreme Court (challenging Bill 44 on grounds of violation of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms - to be heard in October 1985) and an AUPE
appeal to the Alberta Court of Appeal which has been stayed pending the
afore-mentioned Supreme Court decision.

D.
Concluding remarks

	76.	The complaints lodged against the Government of Alberta fall into
two groups.   A number of them appeared to indicate that recent legislative
changes, in particular Bill 44 had changed the process of collective bargaining
and submission to arbitration.   This it was alleged was in clear breach
of ILO principles applying to a structure where limitation on the right
to strike is balanced by free access to binding arbitration.   Others were
individual points of detail.   These taken together it was suggested presented
serious obstacles to freedom of association and free collective bargaining.
Together the two groups of complaints were felt - and the feeling was
strong and genuinely held - to form a coherent policy aimed at weakening
the public service trade union.   I feel it would be helpful to the Committee
on Freedom of Association if I summarised the position as I saw it treating
each of the groups separately and then assessing the overall position.

Collective bargaining and arbitration

	77.	Bill 44 has made several changes to the structure of bargaining, and
recent practice has led to the feeling that major limitations have been
imposed and damage done.   The system as it is now working raises these
issues to which the Committee's attention is specially drawn:

(a)
the system denies public service employees who are covered the right
to strike.   It offers in its place access to binding arbitration;

(b)
the access to arbitration is limited by a jurisdictional clause (section 48(2)).
That clause is in effect the equivalent of a management rights clause
commonly found in a collective agreement.   Two questions were raised:

(i)
the drafting of the statute enables the adjudicating body to take a
wide view of management rights.   In such instances there will be a strong
counter argument raised by the trade union since the exercise of such rights
will undoubtedly, on
many occasions, raise the issue that a trade union
feels properly falls within the ambit of bargaining;

(ii)
the procedural methods adopted put the jurisdictional issue in
the hands of the Public Service Employee Relations Board.   This has the
effect of taking from the arbitrator, seized with problems arising from
the break down of negotiations, some of the issues in dispute.   The trade
unions do seem to be hampered by this duality.

A study of arbitration awards indicates that the application of these provisions
has produced results that narrow considerably the arbitrator's jurisdiction.
It appears that the system, which it will be recalled is aimed at balancing
the lack of the right to strike, is narrowing the issues that are deemed
arbitrable.   It is a matter that calls for careful attention.

(c)
The addition within the statutory rules governing the work of the arbitrator
set out in section 55 of the duty to consider "any fiscal policies that
may be declared from time to time in writing by the Provincial Treasurer".
It appears from what I was told that it is the potential impact of this
clause that is feared.   It is difficult to see the effect of the clause,
taken at face value, on the practice of arbitration.   It cannot be seriously
contended that such fiscal policy would not be considered by an arbitrator
without such direction.   The dangers are, however, there:

	(i)
an arbitrator aware of the precariousness of the profession may give
paramountcy to this one provision.   Although it has to be said that this
realistically is a theoretical danger, such a problem exists whether the
position is statutory or not;

(ii)
the Government may issue its fiscal policy in such a form, for
example, as a pay increase norm.   That would undoubtedly raise the impact
of the particular criterion that is being considered.   It would seriously
fetter the freedom of the arbitrator.   Indeed it would prove to change
the concept of independent arbitration.   Such intervention should be directly,
rather than indirectly, statutory.   The fiscal policies I was shown show
no sign of such interference.   They state clearly and succintly general
economic factors of concern to the Government.   Awards studied cannot
be said to show any misuse of this section to destroy independence.

(d)
exclusions from the process of the Act have been recently extended.
This increases the number of public servants who lack the protection
of the system.   The facts are clearly set out in the evidence given by
the parties and summarised above.   The numbers under the Public Service
Employee Relations Act are not excessive.   Whilst it would be possible
to argue about the
validity, under ILO standards, of a few categories there
is no flagrant neglect of the appropriate principles.

	78.	Attention must be given, however, to the exclusion of health care
workers from the parallel bargaining structures secured by the Labour Relations
Act.   That exclusion is widely drawn and gives too little attention to
the important qualification of "essential worker".   Its width gives real
cause for concern.

Individual items

	79.	These have been set out in detail above and the views of the parties
recorded.   They can be partially grouped:

Four involve statutory changes to legal structures.   Undoubtedly these
changes make the trade unions' position less favourable, hence the reason
for the complaints.   They do not appear, however, to involve significant
fetters on trade union rights.   The Committee will be able to judge them
from the views expressed;  I found little to add.

(a)	s. 74(1) - Labour Relations Act

Requires a duly authorised representative for collective bargaining to
be resident in Alberta.   It was made clear that the legislation does not
debar the trade unions seeking assistance in bargaining from persons resident
outside the Province.

(b)	s. 87 - Labour Relations Act

Allows only one strike or lock-out vote.   This restricts certain previously
allowable trade union tactics but does not prevent sufficient polling to
determine the position prior to calling for a vote.

(c)	s. 49(1) - Labour Relations Act

Where a certification ballot is lost there is provision now for a 90-day
moratorium.   This affects the current practice of signing members on a
short (30 day) basis.   No doubt it will lead to a change of tactics.

(d)	s. 132 - Labour Relations Act

Where a business or enterprise changes hands there has been automatic transfer
to the new employer of the collective bargaining rights and duties.   This
provision now allows the Board to intervene.   Since it is only likely
to do so where difficulties are anticipated the provision appears merely
to regulate and expedite normal practice.   There was no indication
that
this provision would be used to change previous grounds for intervention.

(e)
s. 1(W. 1) of the Labour Relations Act was never promulgated.

	80.	Three issues require separate comment.

(a)	s. 102.2 - Labour Relations Act

This provides the power to put the recommendations of a Disputes Inquiry
Board to the workers concerned after 10 days of issue.   Calling for such
a vote is seen as a denial of the right of the trade union officials to
manage their own union.   It does not, however, deprive individual workers
of their rights.

(b)	s. 105 and s. 106 - Labour Relations Act

The crime of threatening an illegal strike created by these provisions
needs careful consideration.   It appears to put employees and trade union
officials in some jeopardy.   Two problems arise:

	(i)
the definition of a strike is by no means certain and precise.   In
many instances it is possible that the matter could only be determined
by a court.   An employee or trade union official either has his conduct
widely fettered (fearing possible but not certain transgression)  or acts
in good faith, believing the strike to be lawful and subsequently finding
that it is not.   It seems essential that an individual who has no subjective
guilt (i.e. knowledge or belief in the illegality) should be protected;

(ii)
the question of the authority of individuals to act on behalf of
the trade union also may arise.   Again it is to be hoped that clarification
will be undertaken to avoid uncertainty.

(c)
s. 117.94 - Labour Relations Act and s. 92.2 - Public Service Employee
Relations Act

These provisions provide that where illegal strike action takes place the
employer may suspend the deduction of union dues from employees' pay and
their remission to the trade union.   This is an instance of fear that
the provisions may be used unfairly.   The statute appears to allow the
stopping of all dues in the unit consequent upon the action of one individual.
We were told that such response was most unlikely, except in the instance
of specially selected key workers.   Again, it is important to note that
there may be circumstances where the trade union itself is trying to prevent
or end the illegal action.   Retaliatory measures in these circumstances
would not appear to be fair.   Again it is a matter, once aired, that can
be dealt with by clarification of the exact scope of the provision.

General considerations

	81.	Consultation:  The complaints relate to a period when the perceptions
of the Government and the public service trade union were markedly divergent.
Routine consultation on matters such as health and safety appeared to
have continued unaffected.   However, the Government's determination to
act quickly as a result of the major downturn in economic activity meant
that consultation on the legislative changes in Bill 44 were almost entirely
restricted to a public hearing before a committee of the whole legislature.
Since the legislation affected procedures in which the Government and
the trade union played a joint part, it is unfortunate that more time was
not found for consultation.   It would appear that now the urgency of the
economic pressures has abated, the process of consultation can be re-established.
At the very least this will enable misconceptions to be ironed out before
changes are promulgated.

	82.	Attitudes:  It was clear that the trade union believed that it had
been singled out for a concerted attack on its position and rights.   The
steps taken by the Government, both in their obvious intent to restrict
monetary rises and the individual changes, viewed in the worst light, gave
a basis for the formation of such a view.   Whether these fears and the
harshest reading of the legislative changes reflect what were intended
is not easy to determine.   I saw little objective evidence to support
this pessimistic view although I accept that the fear was genuine.

	83.	Two aspects of the underlying problem should be mentioned.

1.
It is important and practically sensible to review the questions raised
as to fears of ways in which the legislation may be used to seriously impede
the trade union in carrying out its bargaining role.   Many of these, it
seemed, could be resolved by an internal understanding secured, for example,
by an exchange of letters.

2.
The second is somewhat more complicated.   The procedures appear to have
changed the perceived independence of both the Public Service Employee
Relations Board and the process of arbitration.   The reasons for this
are set out at the beginning of this section.   It is vital that consideration
be given to ensuring that the independence of arbitration is maintained
and seen to be valued.

	84.	The establishment of better relationships between the parties is desirable
and even possible given the present, less alarming economic position and
the increased awareness of both unions and Government of their respective
responsibilities and obligations.   It will not be easy to build mutual
trust quickly, but if attention is jointly given to the problems that were
disclosed to me better relationships should be attainable.   It is clearly
in the interests of both parties to make efforts to this end and to eliminate
the fears that exist at present of a disregard of ILO principles.

IV.  Case of Alberta - No. 1234

A.
Introduction

	85.	It was in a communication of 19 September 1983 that the Confederation
of Alberta Faculty Associations (CAFA) presented a complaint of alleged
violations of trade union rights in Alberta.   The observations of the
Government of Alberta were contained in a communication dated 21 February
1984.

B.
The issues

	86.	In its communication of 19 September 1983 the CAFA alleged that a
November 1981 amendment to the Universities Act denied the academic staff
of the universities of the Province of Alberta the rights bestowed by Convention
No. 87, ratified by Canada.   The complainant explained that a new section
17(1)(d.1) empowered the Board of Governors at each university to designate
those employees who shall be "academic staff members" and therefore eligible
to join the faculty staff associations at each university.   The provision
reads as follows:

	After consultation with the academic staff association, [The Board of Governors
is entitled] to do one or more of the following:  (i) designate categories
of employees as academic staff members at the university;  (ii) designate
individual employees as academic staff members at the university;  (iii)
change the designation made under the subclauses above.

According to the complainant, this provision gave the right to the employer
to determine who should belong to a faculty association, contrary to Article
2 of Convention No. 87.

	87.	The CAFA explained that the present complaint was similar to previous
complaints brought by various Canadian workers' associations against the
Government, in particular, in 1977, the Canadian Labour Congress and the
Canadian Association of University Teachers' complaint (Case No. 893, last
examined in detail by the Committee in its 194th Report, paragraphs 92
to 118) and the 1981 complaint of the Alberta Association of College Faculties
(Case No. 1055, examined by the Committee in its 214th Report, paras. 332-350).

	88.	The CAFA pointed out that it had delayed presenting a complaint to
the ILO concerning the Universities Amendment Act of 1981 in order to observe
what would actually occur in the initial determination by the Board of
Governors of who should be designated as academic staff, and hence members
of an association under the new legislation.   It cited an example of such
a determination:  the
governing authority of Athabasca University declared
its intention to designate as "academic staff members" fewer than one-third
of the persons who had formerly been members of the Athabasca University
Faculty Association by an arbitrary declaration of who were to be excluded
on the basis that they were involved in senior management or that their
activities did not meet the governing authority's definition of "academic".
According to the complainant, the Athabasca University Faculty Association
was able to persuade the governing authority concerned that the original
definitions were unwarranted, and eventually an agreement on designation
was reached.   However, according to the complainant, given that the Act
continued to give governing authorities the right to revoke designation
at will, following consultation, the legislative threat to freedom of association
continued.

	89.	In its communication of 21 February 1984, the Government explained
that universities in Alberta were created and structured in accordance
with the principle of academic freedom, the right of each individual member
of the faculty of the institution to enjoy the freedom to study, to inquire,
and to communicate ideas.   The Government added that the principle of
academic freedom must be safeguarded through appropriate institutional
structures and the role of academic professionals in the management of
universities had long been recognised.

	90.	According to the Government, from the complexity of the academic and
administrative functions undertaken by such institutions stemmed the recognition
that university management is the joint responsibility of the various major
elements of the academic community, including faculty, administrators,
governing boards and students.   In particular, the faculty must play a
major role in determining curriculum, subject-matter and method of instruction,
research, requirement for degrees, academic appointments and granting of
tenure and dismissals, since only the faculty had the competence needed
for making and forming judgements on such matters.   The Government cited
the example of the structure at the University of Alberta where faculty
members played a substantial role in administration and in setting the
overall university policy;  "staff members" are defined in the faculty
association collective agreement as all persons who have been appointed
to full-time teaching and research positions which includes all senior
academics and administrators, such as the president, vice-president and
deans.   The Board of Governors there consists of, amongst others, the
president of the university and two members of the academic staff.   The
General Faculties Council, which is responsible for the academic affairs
of the university subject to the authority of the university, consists
of, inter alia, the president, the vice-president, the deans of all the
faculties, the directors of each school, the chief librarian, the registrar
and elected members from all faculties and schools.   The Government explained
that all these persons are "academic staff" yet they are active and influential
members of the very body that acts as the university board's instrument
for internal college management,
which includes dealing with questions
of tenure, salaries and promotions and the hearing of appeals and disciplinary
matters.

	91.	The Government, therefore, concluded that within the university environment
traditional employer/employee or managerial/non-managerial distinctions
did not apply.   All interest groups active within the institution played
a role in its management, including the designation of "academic staff",
because the Board of Governors comprised significant staff representation.
The Government stressed that the Universities Amendment Act attempted
to create a framework within which dialogue regarding more traditional
conditions of work issues could take place, while at the same time recognising
the unique nature of the universities.   In particular, the Act designated
the Board of Governors as the final authority and, secondly, the Act required
"consultation" which the Government interpreted as including full consultation
enabling the persons involved to have reasonable, ample and sufficient
opportunity to express their views.

	92.	Referring to the example cited by the complainant, the Government
explained that in early 1983 the Athabasca University Governing Council
declared its intention to designate as "academic staff members" fewer than
one-third of those persons who were formerly members of the Athabasca University
Faculty Association.   The Governing Council had felt that many professional
staff were involved in senior management positions and their activities
did not fall in the Governing Council's definition of "academic";  as a
result of consultation between the Governing Council and the Faculty Association,
an altered scope of designation had been reached, with the result that
many of the persons involved - whose designations had been changed - had
been redesignated as "academic staff members".   According to the Government,
this example proved the effectiveness of consultation as required under
the Universities Amendment Act, in particular in view of the fact that
the Governing Council had recognised that fragmentation of the professional
staff into small bargaining units was not an advantage to the University.

C.
Information obtained during the mission

	93.	During discussions with representatives of CAFA, two points were emphasised.
First, the union was trying to have consultations, in good faith, with
the employers (the Boards of Governors) in an effort to overcome the restrictive
nature of s. 17(1)(d.1);  such informal consultations had, in fact, worked
in the Athabasca situation referred to in the written complaint.   Secondly,
CAFA stressed its concern that there was no right to appeal a designation
of academic staff made by the Boards of Governors under s. 17(1)(d.1).
CAFA considered that a possible solution to the situation would be to
include provisions in the legislation for third party arbitration on the
question of designation, such as exists for collective bargaining
deadlocks.
I noted that this was a useful suggestion since, in most cases, the job
descriptions indicated those members of the university staff who were involved
in teaching and research and those who were employed in managerial tasks.

	94.	The Government pointed out that the Athabasca situation had been particularly
tense since the campus had, at the time of the complaint, just been transferred
from Edmonton to the northern town of Athabasca (after which the university
had been named) to continue its "open university" curriculae.   According
to the Government none of the three other Alberta universities had had
problems, and the employees of the University of Alberta (in Edmonton)
had indeed been surprised at the complaint because they had no trouble
in negotiating with their Board of Governors the question of academic staff.
Nevertheless, the Government recognised that the legislation did not
address the radical differences in the four universities of the Province.
I pointed out that, although no problems were occurring at present with
the legislation, CAFA wanted some form of machinery to protect against
situations such as had occurred in Athabasca.   To this the Government
replied that since the other universities had managed to arrive at designations,
no major change in policy could be envisaged.   I indicated that informal
machinery such as a letter of understanding would perhaps suffice.

D.
Concluding remarks

	95.	The issue here is a simple one.   The power given to the employer
to designate staff as academic or not gave a high degree of control over
the nature and size of the bargaining unit.   Industrial relations in universities,
which have a large degree of participation and consultation, is of an individual
nature.   Relationships have been excellent but the designation power led
to a serious problem in Athabasca University, a body which because it concentrated
upon "distance learning", that is to say students not on campus, has a
special staff structure.   That problem has been satisfactorily resolved
but the Staff Association has been alerted to a weakness in the law.

	96.	There is no doubt that a unilateral power to designate does potentially
put the trade union at a serious disadvantage.   All that is being sought
is access to independent arbitration of disputed designation.   This appears
to be a necessary safeguard to protect the integrity of the bargaining
unit.   It seems most unlikely that the machinery will often be used for
the relationship appears to be good.   Consideration could, accordingly,
be given to the introduction of the simple safeguard that is being sought
by the union.

V.  Case of Ontario  - No. 1172

A.
Introduction

	97.	The complaint of the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC), on behalf of
its affiliated organisations the National Union of Provincial Government
Employees (NUPGE), the Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU) and
the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), was contained in a communication
dated 15 November 1982.   The CLC supplied additional information in communications
dated 15 December 1982, 16 February and 28 October 1983 and 10 January
1984.   The World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession
(WCOTP) presented its complaint, on behalf of its affiliates the Canadian
Teachers' Federation and the Ontario Teachers' Federation, in a letter
of 8 February 1983 and further information in a communication of 7 March
1983.   The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) presented its
complaint in a letter dated 6 April 1984.   The Government sent its observations
in communications dated 25 April 1983 and 7 June and 16 October 1984.

B.
The issues

	98.	In its initial communications the CLC alleged that new Ontario legislation,
"the Act respecting the restraint of compensation in the public sector
of Ontario and the monitoring of inflationary conditions in the economy
of the province" (known as Bill 179), violated Articles 3 and 4 of Convention
No. 87 and Article 4 of Convention No. 98.   The Act came into force in
late 1982 and covered employees of the Ontario Public Service, all Ontario
municipalities, municipal and provincial corporations, commissions, boards
and agencies including universities, colleges, hospitals and health boards.
In particular, the CLC alleged that of the Act took away the right of
the workers covered to organise and bargain collectively because it allowed
the Provincial Government to extend, arbitrarily, collective agreements
for a 12-month period during which it could unilaterally determine employees'
wage increases.   In addition, according to the CLC, the Inflation Restraint
Board established under the Act had been given sweeping powers to resolve
disputes without reference to the unions or employees concerned.

	99.	The WCOTP, in its communication of 8 February 1983, stated that Bill
179 constituted an unjustifiable interference with bargaining rights.
It pointed out that Bill 179 overrode the usual collective bargaining
process prescribed in various specific Provincial Acts by imposing legislated
limits on the wages of public sector employees, including teachers, because
it took effect "notwithstanding any other Act, except the Human Rights
Code, 1981 ...".   The WCOTP further stated that no grave national emergency
existed in Ontario such as to justify this substantial restriction on the
fundamental right to collective bargaining, the Government's professed
commitment to the reduction of inflation not being a sufficient reason
for this suspension by legislative action.

	100.	According to the additional information provided by the CLC on 16 February
1983 the Act in fact had become law on 15 December 1982 with retroactive
operation as from 21 September 1982 and applied also to privately owned,
para-public sector companies contracted to or funded by the Provincial
Government, for example, nursing homes, ambulance services, garbage contractors
as well as to certain private charitable organisations and non-government
agencies such as the Art Gallery of Ontario and the Botanical Gardens (section
6).   The complainant stated that the coverage of the Act might further
be extended by regulation by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, without
legislative discussion (section 25).

	101.	The CLC explained its dissatisfaction with the Act as follows:  the
Act imposed a 5 per cent increase on the compensation received by employees
concerned for at least a one-year period (called "the control year"), regardless
of the rate of inflation and the value of wage and benefit settlements
in the private sector (section 12);  it "rolled back" or expropriated,
without compensation, the existing contractual rights of employees under
collective agreements which extended beyond 1 October 1983 and limited
the increase in compensation and monetary benefits payable to such employees
under such agreements (sections 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12);  it removed the right
to strike or to binding arbitration in so far as such activities related
to efforts to obtain monetary benefits in excess of those dictated by the
Act (section 13);  it appeared to allow the parties to a collective agreement
to amend non-monetary issues of that agreement without providing a mechanism
for such amendment because the right to strike and the right to binding
arbitration were removed (section 15);  it prevented a union from negotiating
a first agreement with an employer where the certification of the bargaining
unit had occurred after 21 September 1982 because employees could only
strike or obtain binding arbitration on non-monetary issues (section 13,
in conjunction with Ontario Regulation 57 of 21 January 1983 made under
the Act whereby first agreements made after 21 September must comply with
the 5 per cent increase in compensation laid down in the Act);  it discriminated
against public sector employees by subjecting them to the above restrictions
whereas private sector employees were not so restricted.   The complainant
pointed out, in addition, that even if the parties to a collective agreement
had agreed to an increase in wages or monetary benefits in excess of that
permitted by the Act, the Inflation Restraint Board - consisting of appointed
officials of the Ontario Government - could issue an order preventing the
parties from implementing their agreement (section 21 of the Act).   In
addition, the orders of the Board might be filed with the Supreme Court
of Ontario so that they had the force of a judgement, thus allowing the
Government to enforce them through any of the judicial methods of enforcement,
such as imprisonment and fines.

	102.	According to the CLC, such restrictions on collective bargaining
as listed above violated Article 4 of Convention No. 98 and Article 7 of
Convention No. 151, and the lack of disputes settlement machinery infringed
Article 8 of Convention No. 151.   Moreover, the CLC considered that Article
3 of Convention No. 87 was violated because of the alteration, by legislation,
of the conditions of work over a certain period of time and the removal
of the unions' possibility to act through negotiation.   The CLC pointed
out that under section 2(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms,
incorporated as part of the Federal Constitution in 1981, all persons had
the right to freedom of association in Canada;  in view of the new legislation,
public servants and other individuals covered by the Act in Ontario were
now denied freedom of association.

	103.	The WCOTP, in its communication of 7 March 1983, recalled that, under
the Ontario School Boards and Teachers Collective Negotiations Act 1975,
a collective bargaining process had been established according to which
- if initial negotiations between teachers and their employing boards failed
- the following action could be taken:  initial fact-finding, mediation,
voluntary binding arbitration, final offer selection, strike or lock-out.
According to the complainant, free collective bargaining under this process
had not resulted in inflationary wage pressures;  in fact, in every quarter
since 1978, the rate of teachers' salaries had fallen below the rate of
inflation producing a cumulative decline in purchasing power of more than
7 per cent.

	104.	In addition, the WCOTP listed its principal criticisms of the new
legislation as follows:  in cases where negotiations relating to the 1981-82
contract period were continuing, Bill 179 terminated negotiations, declared
the previous agreement to be still in force until the first anniversary
following 1 October 1982 (called "the transition period") and imposed a
wage increase not to exceed 9 per cent.   Agreements already in effect
and expiring before 30 September 1983, were deemed to be extended for a
period of 12 months (again, "the control year"), with a wage increase of
5 per cent.   According to the WCOTP, Bill 179 also forbade the payment
of any merit award, service-related increment, long-service bonus or allowance
in respect of successful completion of a training programme or course of
education, regardless of whether such payments were provided for in collective
agreements, if the effect would be to increase total remuneration to a
level above $35,000 per annum.   This extension by legislation of collective
agreements eliminated the possibility of negotiation even on non-monetary
items, such as conditions of work, and, since strikes were not permitted
during the life of a contract, Bill 179 amounted to denial of the right
to strike;  thus, affected employees would have no way to make any changes
to their working conditions.

	105.	Lastly, the WCOTP criticised the membership and procedures of the
Inflation Restraint Board set up under Bill 179 - in particular the lack
of appeal of its decisions - as well as the wide powers conferred on the
Lieutenant Governor in Council.   The WCOTP stated
that where the right
to strike was removed, it was imperative to replace it with an adequate
dispute resolution mechanism - Bill 179 left affected employees with no
such mechanism.

	106.	In its communication of 28 October 1983, the CLC referred to a recent
decision of the Supreme Court of Ontario (Broadway Manor case) and the
Government's public announcement of its intention to extend the duration
of its control programme by legislation at the beginning of November 1983.
The decision, dated 24 October 1983, ruled that section 13(b) of Bill
179 was invalid because it infringed the right to freedom of association
- which included the right to change bargaining agents, to bargain collectively
and to strike - which was guaranteed under the Canadian Constitution.
Only this section of the legislation was held to be unconstitutional because
it restricted collective bargaining over non-compensation matters which,
according to the Court, could not be justified as being reasonably necessary
to control wage increases.   On 10 January 1984, the CLC sent certain documentation
referring to the replacement of Bill 179 by new draft legislation (known
as Bill 111) which, if enacted, would take effect as of 1 October 1983.

	107.	On 6 April 1984 the Service Employees International Union presented
its submissions against Bill 179 reiterating the above-mentioned points
for dissatisfaction with the legislation (it removed the right to change
bargaining agents, to bargain collectively on non-monetary as well as monetary
matters and the right to strike or resort to interest arbitration for a
broadly defined public sector) and adding that the legislation is not in
harmony with Convention No. 154.

	108.	Referring to the importance of the independence and autonomy of parties
to the collective bargaining process and the voluntary negotiation of collective
agreements recognised by the Committee on Freedom of Association as fundamental
aspects of Convention No. 98, the SEIU claimed that Bill 179, by interfering
with existing provisions of freely negotiated collective agreements, constituted
an unnecessary and unacceptable interference in the results of free collective
bargaining and contravened Convention No. 154.   It cited the example of
the Sensenbrenner Hospital employees who were awarded an 11 per cent overall
pay increase in the summer of 1982 by a three-man interest arbitration
board and some of whom - since they were among the lowest paid workers
in the hospital sector - were awarded a supplementary award in October
1982.   On 2 November 1983 the Inflation Restraint Board ruled that the
special wage increases contained in the supplementary award were null and
void to the extent that they exceeded the 5 per cent limit prescribed by
the Act, and ordered that any wages received by the 72 employees concerned
in excesss of the prescribed increase were to be repaid to the hospital.
In January 1984 the Board had refused a request made by the SEIU that
it  recommend, under section 17(5) of the Act, that the employees of the
Sensenbrenner Hospital be exempt from its application.   According to the
SEIU, there had not been any
recommendations or exemptions granted to workers
under these provisions of the Act.

	109.	Lastly, the SEIU criticised the Government's statements that conditions
of work other than compensation were not disrupted by Bill 179, that non-monetary
aspects of a compensation plan might be made under section 15 of that Act,
that the right to select a bargaining agent was only delayed for at most
one year and, most importantly according to the complainant, that although
the scope of collective bargaining had been temporarily narrowed it still
covered trade-offs between wages and benefits and the determination of
non-monetary terms and conditions of employment.   The SEIU alleged that
this last justification was entirely inaccurate and unfounded especially
in view of the Act's suspension of the obligation to bargain in good faith
as required under the Labour Relations Act.

	110.	Responding to the complaints in its communication of 25 April 1983,
the Government stated that its adoption of the new legislation was a responsible
and necessary action, taken only after consideration of a wide range of
restraint options to overcome the worst recession since the Great Depression.
According to the Government, in 1981 and the first half of 1982 public
sector wage increases were higher than private sector settlements in Ontario
and there was evidence that administered prices - prices set or directly
authorised by ministries or public agencies - were a major factor perpetuating
inflation.

	111.	The Government pointed out that the compensation restraint programme
provided for a temporary (in most cases, only one year) constraint on wage
increases of up to 5 per cent or 9 per cent, allowing conditions of work
other than compensation to be changed by mutual agreement (section 15 of
the Act).   It stated that special provision was made for workers with
low incomes (section 12) and emphasised that the Lieutenant Governor in
Council could exempt compensation plans from the Act (section 25).   According
to the Government, trade-offs between wages and benefits could be made
with the permission of the Inflation Restraint Board under section 14,
and it listed examples of such trade-offs.

	112.	As regards the alleged infringement of Convention No. 87, the Government
emphasised that the legislation in fact favoured worker organisations in
one way because workers with collective agreements were automatically entitled
to a 5 per cent wage increase whereas other workers could receive less
(section 12(1)(d)).   For workers already represented wishing to change
certified representatives, the Government admitted that the extension of
collective agreements under the Act would delay this for, at most, one
year, but pointed out that under the normal collective bargaining system
such a change was in any case also subject to a time-limit - of 90 to 120
days, for example under the Labour Relations Act.   As for the alleged
limitation on the unions' freedom of action, the Government stated that
this was incorrect:  while the scope of negotiations had been temporarily
restricted, the collective bargaining system remained in place and
unions
were free to organise their activities, the right to strike and to binding
arbitration only being delayed temporarily.   An example of this freedom
of action was the case of groups which had been certified before 21 September
1982 but which had not attained their first collective agreement.   Under
Regulation 57/83 made under the Act, such groups could use all of the normal
collective bargaining procedures - including strike action - to arrive
at first collective agreements on condition that the agreement provided
for a compensation increase of 5 per cent for a 12-month period commencing
between 1 October 1982 and 1 October 1983 and that the provisions of the
whole agreement were substantially comparable to those of employees in
related labour markets.

	113.	As regards the alleged infringement of Conventions Nos. 98 and 151,
the Government stated that the Act did not discontinue the voluntary negotiation
machinery but merely prolonged collective agreements, with specified provisions
for wage increases, for the period stipulated.   It stressed that non-monetary
terms and conditions could be altered by mutual agreement and the parties
were free to agree to use mediators and arbitrators in this connection.
According to the Government, there had been quite a few instances of
collective bargaining resulting in the full 9 per cent being granted for
the 12-month period prior to the control year under section 10 of the Act.
As for the limitation on disputes settlement procedures, the Government
stated that, under section 14 of the Act, the Inflation Restraint Board
could arbitrate, giving decisions which were binding on the parties and
also indicating its reasons although the Act did not require it to do so.
Moreover, the Government pointed out that under sections 17 and 25 of
the Act groups of employees could be exempted from the application of Part
II of the Act;  it recognised that these provisions had not yet been utilised.

	114.	In its communication of 7 June 1984, the Government referred to the
appeal lodged against the decision of the Divisional Court of the Supreme
Court of Ontario dated 24 October 1983 which held section 13(b) of the
Inflation Restraint Act to be invalid.   The Government enclosed extracts
from Hansard containing statements made by the Attorney General of Ontario
which reflected the Government's concern over "the implications of the
very broad interpretation given by the Court to freedom of association".

	115.	In its communication of 16 October 1984, the Government again referred
to the economic crisis of 1981 which had led all Canadian provinces except
Manitoba to introduce public sector restraint programmes.   According to
the Government, 71 per cent of all agreements and 69 per cent of all employees
affected by the Inflation Restraint Act had been subject to controls for
12 months only.   It also presented statistics to show that after the Act
had been introduced there had been a dramatic decrease in the rate of inflation.

	116.	As regards the negotiation of non-monetary issues under section 15
of the Act, the Government pointed out that the Ontario
Ministry of Labour
had continued to offer and provide mediation services to parties covered
by the Act who agreed to bargain non-compensatory issues, and negotiations
had taken place on such items as grievance procedures, pupil-teacher ratios
and job security.   The Inflation Restraint Board had made 655 decisions
and orders between 1 December 1982 and December 1983, a number of which
resulted from issues which had arisen in negotiation.   The Government
contended that such mediation fulfilled the requirements of Convention
No. 151.

	117.	The Government also pointed out that the Lieutenant Governor's power
under the Act to terminate the application of the controls to any compensation
plan had been used with respect to certain municipal employees' retirement
plan (Regulation 92/83) and to exclude certain handicapped people, persons
not covered by minimum wage legislation and persons who received less than
50 per cent of their expenses from a government employer (Regulations 819/82
and 844/82).   Moreover, the Act required the Inflation Restraint Board
to investigate price increases in government services called "administered
services" referred to it by the Minister.   For example, in 1982, the Board
had investigated a price increase for Northern and Central Gas which had
been approved by the Ontario Energy Board, and had concluded that the price
increase did not comply with the Minister's criteria;  the proposed price
was subsequently reduced to bring it into compliance.   Moreover, the Cabinet
Committee on Administered Prices had maintained an increase of only 5 per
cent in over half the cases submitted to it, e.g. for legal aid fees, beer
prices, school-bus tariffs, tuition fees for Canadian students, provincial
park fees, resident fishing licence fees and Northern Telephone Ltd. charges.
Thus 92 per cent of the adminstered prices had kept within the 5 per
cent increase guide-line.

	118.	The Government explained that the legislation which replaced Bill 179
as of October 1983 - the Public Sector Prices and Compensation Review Act
(known as Bill 111) - provided for full collective bargaining of both compensation
and non-compensation issues and allowed the normal strike or arbitration
procedures when the parties were unable to conclude a collective agreement.

	119.	Lastly, the Government referred to the SEIU's allegations, stating
that at no time during the operation of the Inflation Restraint Act had
the right of employees to establish, join and participate fully in organisations
of their own choosing been withheld.   Only situations such as that which
had arisen in the Broadway Manor case had been affected by the Act;  in
that case only certification had been delayed and certification under Ontario
law was not a prerequisite to the lawful establishment of or participation
in a "new" union.   The Government stated that its appeal to the Ontario
Court of Appeal against the Divisional Supreme Court decision in the Broadway
Manor case had been heard on 4 June 1984 but the decision had not, at the
time of the Government's reply to the ILO, been rendered.   As for the
situation in the Sensenbrenner Hospital, the Government denied that the
Inflation Restraint Board had ordered a
recovery of the excess payments
that had already been made, but merely referred the matter back to the
parties.

C.
Information obtained during the mission

	120.	During the mission's stay in Toronto I had the opportunity to meet
representatives of the following organisations:  Service Employees International
Union (local 204), the Ontario Public Service Employees' Union, the Canadian
Union of Public Employees and the Ontario Teachers' Federation.   These
meetings were followed by a meeting with a number of Government officials
representing the Province of Ontario.   In the course of my meetings with
the trade union organisations I obtained information in the form of oral
presentations and written submissions.   Written submissions and documentation
were also supplied on behalf of the provincial government.

	121.	At my initial meetings with the Canadian Labour Congress in Ottawa
the problems referred to in the complaint resulting from the coming into
force, on 21 September 1982, of the Inflation Restraint Act (Bill 179),
had already been mentioned.

	122.	Since the main thrust of the arguments advanced by all the trade
unions was virtually identical as regards what they considered to be a
violation of their trade union rights consequent upon the enactment of
Bill 179, and to some extent, the later enactment, on 10 October 1983,
of the Public Sector Prices and Compensation Review Act (Bill 111), it
will suffice here to summarise these arguments and the information supplied
in substantiation of them.

	123.	I should, at this point, state that I emphasised to all the parties
that no formal allegations concerning Bill 111 had been submitted to the
ILO and that, strictly speaking, this legislation fell outside my terms
of reference.   However, since Bill 111 is directly relevant to the issues
raised in the formal complaints and is the latest act by the Government
in the area of public sector collective bargaining, I felt that it was
appropriate to record the unions', as well as the Government's views on
this later enactment and its effect on public sector bargaining.   Indeed,
at the time of the mission, Bill 111, itself a temporary enactment, was
due to expire.

	124.	The principal claim of all the unions was that the enactment of Bill
179 in September 1982 not only put an end to collective bargaining, and
indeed to trade union activity, for a period of almost two years, but also
prevented the coming into force of collective agreements freely concluded
prior to the Act.   Generally, agreements that were due to expire on or
after 10 October 1981 would be extended for a period of 12 months provided
that compensation rates did not exceed 9 per cent.   These agreements on
their expiry and every other agreement would be deemed to include a provision
increasing
compensation rates by 5 per cent for the ensuing 12-month period.
The unions argued that it was questionable that the economic situation
in the country, and more specifically in the province, justified these
measures and even if there were economic difficulties there was no justification
for what amounted to a virtual ban on trade union activity for the period
during which the Act was to remain in force.   In effect, since collective
bargaining was excluded, even on non-monetary issues, there could be no
arbitration, which was an accepted substitute for the denial of the right
to strike in the public service.

	125.	The SEIU, the majority of whose 33,000 members were employed in the
hospital and nursing home sector said that it had always accepted the substitution
of the right to strike for the right of independent and binding third party
arbitration.   Bill 179, and subsequently Bill 111, showed that the Government
supported neither the right to strike nor truly independent and impartial
arbitration.   Similar arguments were advanced by OPSEU, representing 80,000
members, who added that the 5 per cent limit on wage increases had widened
the gap between lower-paid and higher-paid employees.   Some 15,000 of
their members employed in part-time employment, for whom protracted negotiations
had resulted in a two-year agreement for a 9 per cent and 11 per cent increase
in increment, had been denied the 11 per cent increase on the enactment
of Bill 179.   Other categories of workers had been similarly affected.
OPSEU also introduced witnesses who described the effects of Bill 179
on laboratory workers and on the support staff of community colleges (approx.
5,000) who had been guaranteed, during the 1981 bargaining operation, that
their wages would be increased by 20 per cent over the following three
years.   All of these categories had suffered under the wage controls imposed
by Bill 179.

	126.	The CUPE emphasised that Bill 179 not only restrained compensation
but eliminated the right to bargain effectively with employers over non-monetary
provisions in a collective agreement.   This, they added, had been criticised
by the Ontario Court of Appeal (Broadway Manor case) in a decision issued
on 22 October 1984, a decision that was of little practical relevance since
Bill 179 had then, for all practical purposes, been replaced by other legislation
(Bill 111).   CUPE also emphasised that during the existence of Bill 179,
workers governed by the Labour Relations Act were effectively deprived
of the right to strike.   In addition, the possibility of resorting to
arbitration by workers governed by the provisions of either the Hospital
Labour Disputes Arbitration Act or the Crown Employees Collective Bargaining
Act was effectively eliminated.

	127.	Another point made by CUPE was that, as a result of Bill 179, they
had originally claimed that the right to organise was infringed since workers
could not change bargaining agents during the control period.   This was
another matter which has been settled by the Court of Appeal of Ontario
in the Broadway Manor case.   The Court held that the effect of Bill 179
was not to extend collective agreements themselves, but only to extend
the terms and conditions of
such agreements.   Bill 179 did not, therefore,
curtail the right to change bargaining agents.   As stated above, however,
the decision in the Broadway Manor case was only handed down on the expiry
of Bill 179.

	128.	CUPE provided a number of examples of some 100 agreements, concluded
prior to the enactment of Bill 179, that had been "rolled back" by the
Act, and explained that many low-paid workers were affected by this measure.
This union also mentioned that, in the hospital sector, a close wage
relationship had always existed between workers represented by CUPE and
those represented by SEIU.   However, the SEIU hospital members, who do
exactly the same work as CUPE members, were awarded 11 per cent in a one-year
contract arbitrated just prior to the institution of Bill 179, whereas
CUPE members received a maximum of 9 per cent in the first year of their
agreement, pursuant to the provisions of Bill 179.   As a result CUPE members
were adversely treated in comparison with SEIU members simply because of
the luck of different termination dates of collective agreements.

	129.	The Ontario Teachers' Federation, which represents over 104,000 teachers
employed in the publicly supported elementary and secondary schools in
Ontario, also complained that Bill 179, and later Bill 111, had the effect
of overriding the negotiating process established under the School Boards
and Teachers' Collective Negotiations Act, 1975, as amended in 1983.
In its view no economic emergency existed in Ontario to justify the enactment
of Bill 179.   In addition, the right to strike which teachers have in
Ontario, was suspended during the control period imposed by the Act.
Detailed information was supplied by the Federation showing the impact
of Bill 179 on the wages of teachers in the province.

	130.	The Public Sector Prices and Compensation Review Act, 1983 (known
as Bill 111), which replaced Bill 179 did not, according to the unions,
restore free collective bargaining but imposed, in a more subtle manner,
a further period of restrictions on collective bargaining.   In effect,
Bill 111 provided that, during a "restraint period" of 12 months, the Inflation
Restraint Board was empowered to fix and monitor all changes in compensation
in the same broadly defined public sector as Bill 179, in order to determine
whether compensation changes complied with the fiscal policy of the province
as determined by the Treasurer of Ontario.   The Treasurer had announced
that increases in average compensation should not exceed 5 per cent during
this restraint period.   Furthermore, the Government had announced that
government grants and transfers to publicly funded institutions covered
by Bill 111, as well as allocations to its own civil servants would provide
for average compensation increases of up to 5 per cent.   While compensation
increases in excess of 5 per cent were possible, the Inflation Restraint
Board, the Government and leaders of municipalities had made it clear that
any attempt to exceed the 5 per cent guide-line would result in lower transfer
payments from the province.

	131.	In submitting these comments on Bill 111, both CUPE and SEIU also
referred to the requirement, under section 10 of the Bill, that
arbitrators
take into account the "employers' ability to pay [...] in the light of
existing provincial fiscal policy".   According to the unions, the Government,
using this device, could unilaterally determine the funding of public-sector
institutions, and the reliance on the employer's ability to pay effectively
meant that the Government could also unilaterally establish wage rates.
Any claim of independence and impartiality of the arbitration process
was also undermined.   The Canadian Teachers' Federation submitted similar
comments in connection with Bill 111.

	132.	In addition, all the unions referred to the fact that a number of
a well-known interest arbitrators had rejected the criterion of "ability
to pay" for public-sector wage determination.   Statements made by some
leading arbitrators were produced in which they referred to the "atmosphere
of intimidation" which the legislation engendered and to the public statements
made by the Treasurer indicating that, unless the economic policy of the
Government was followed, restrictive legislation of a long-term nature
would be introduced.

	133.	With the representatives of the Government of the Province of Ontario
I raised all the issues that had been brought to my attention during my
meetings with the various public sector unions.   The Government representatives
claimed that compelling reasons of national and provincial economic interest
had led the Government to conclude that it should control wage rates in
the public sector.   In 1982, they explained, Ontario was experiencing
recession, double-digit inflation (11-12 per cent), loss of international
competitiveness and loss of jobs in the private sector (approximately 164,000
jobs in Ontario alone).   The restrictions on public-sector wages contained
in Bill 179 were imposed as an exceptional measure.   The Bill was not
intended to restructure labour legislation in the province, nor was it
intended to be permanent.   Bill 179 imposed wage controls for only 12
months for the majority of the employees, and only 31 per cent of the employees
affected were subject to the transition period which could extend controls
for two years.   No employees were now affected by Bill 179.

	134.	The subsequent legislation (the Public Sector Prices and Compensation
Review Act, 1983 - Bill 111), established a guide-line for public-sector
increases for a one-year period.   In the case of public-sector employees
whose agreements were determined by interest arbitration, the new legislation
required interest arbitrators to cost any change in the terms of collective
agreements and to consider the employer's ability to pay.   In the case
of public-sector employees who negotiated agreements (including those who
had the right to strike) the legislation required the filing of information
with respect to any changes in the compensation plan.   If an arbitrator
determined, or the parties agreed to wage increases in excess of the 5
per cent guide-line, the legislation had no mechanism to "roll back" the
wage increases thus determined or negotiated.   The Government representatives
added that, since Bill 111 was now at an end, no wage restraint legislation
was presently in force in Ontario.

	135.	The Government representatives further explained that, in considering
the economic situation in 1982 a number of options for action had been
considered, including a national programme of wage and price controls.
Because a consensus with the other provinces could not be reached on
this, and because of the difficulties encountered by reason of the nature
of the Province of Ontario itself as regards a possible programme covering
public and private-sector workers, a programme controlling prices and wages
in the public sector alone was decided.

	136.	The Government emphasised that safeguards were provided to protect
workers' living standards.   In addition to controlling prices, the rate
of inflation was lowered (to less than 11 per cent during the third quarter
of 1982).   Since Bill 179 was introduced, inflation had continued to drop,
and for the first quarter of 1985, it stood at 3.6 per cent.   Public-sector
job security and employment was also maintained at a time when there was
much job loss in the private sector.   Fair and reasonable increases were
also ensured for employees covered by the legislation.   In this connection,
the Government supplied statistical information showing that increases
under the legislation were comparable to private-sector wage increases
and had in fact exceeded private-sector wage increases since the fourth
quarter of 1983.   Bill 179 also made provision for minimum increases,
low-income earners and for wage adjustments.   It also permitted newly
certified unions, i.e. those certified prior to the enactment of Bill 179,
to freely negotiate compensation increases for the period leading into
the control period in their first agreements.   The ability to change non-compensatory
items of a collective agreement by mutual consent was also maintained by
the Act as was eventually shown by the decision of the Ontario Court of
Appeal to this effect in the Broadway Manor case.

	137.	Referring to the SEIU complaint that Bill 179 had suspended the right
to change bargaining agents, the right to bargain collectively on non-monetary
items and the right to strike or to resort to interest arbitration, the
Government representatives referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal
in the Broadway Manor case which established that the union was wrong in
its allegations.   The Court had, however, expressed some doubt that the
employees could strike or resort to arbitration without actually making
any decision on this point.

	138.	The Government added that a wide range of consultations had taken
place prior to the enactment of Bill 179 and there had been a broad political
consensus for its adoption.   The Government had been satisfied with the
results of Bill 179 and had replaced it by Bill 111 which was not an exceptional
measure taken in a period of crisis.   Bill 111 was intended as a further
step towards a normal situation and re-established collective bargaining
in the public sector.   The continuing existence of the Inflation Restraint
Board was merely for the purpose of ensuring its participation in current
litigation.

	139.	As regards the requirement, under Bill 111, that interest arbitrators
take account of provincial fiscal policy and the ability to pay of the
employer, the Government representatives pointed out that sums transferred
to public institutions had always been decided upon by the Government.
Under Bill 111 the amounts were clearly stated.   In cases where the
5 per cent norm was exceeded either by arbitrators or by the needs of a
public institution ways could be found to provide the extra funds required.

	140.	Regarding the unions' concern that the Government had appeared to
be constantly trying to find ways of reducing flexibility and placing pressures
on arbitrators, which eroded and damaged confidence in the arbitration
system, the Government representatives emphasised that arbitrators were
merely asked in Bill 111 to keep certain criteria in mind.   Many did not
feel bound by these criteria and some 200 awards had been made in 1984/85,
the majority of these exceeding negotiated settlements.   Under the Labour
Relations Act, a panel of arbitrators had been established for grievance
disputes and it was generally from this panel that arbitrators were selected
to deal with interest disputes.   The Government admitted that its information
on wage settlements in certain sectors (e.g. in the municipalities) was
inadequate but that efforts were being made to resolve this problem.

	141.	On the question of "roll backs", the Government admitted that this
had been seen to be harsh but again stated that they had been dictated
by economic necessity.   The Government also pointed out that it could
not recall, apart from one or two cases, that the problem of the absence
of negotiations on non-monetary items to have been a significant one.

	142.	The Government also admitted that there might be some longer-term
effects of Bill 179, for example on job evaluation and classification programmes,
but it was expected that the return to collective bargaining would resolve
any anomalies that remained.   It was also clear that, in some cases, employers
had taken advantage of the legislation by refusing to pay negotiated wage
increases.   This was, however, a matter for the courts and one over which
the Government had little control.

	143.	Referring again to the decision in the Broadway Manor case and the
problem of changing bargaining agents during the one-year period of control
under Bill 179, the Government explained that it had considered this matter
prior to the Bill's adoption.   It had been thought that it was inappropriate
for a change in bargaining agent to take place during that period since
the incoming union would not be able to negotiate.   The Government had
discussed this question with the unions whose reaction to the problem had
been a mixed one.   In any event, according to the Government, since the
public service unions were well-established it was unlikely that any challenge
would have been made during the control period.   The Government recalled
that newly certified unions were not affected by what was subsequently
proved - by the decision in the Broadway Manor case - to be a false problem.

D.
Concluding remarks

	144.	An obvious feature of this complaint is that it concerns the provisions
and effects of the Inflation Restraint Act, 1982 (Bill 179) which is no
longer in force.   Indeed, that statute was followed by Bill 111, a measure
which itself is due to expire at the end of September 1985.   No further
legislation in this area has been proposed at the present time.   It is
none the less important to complete the process of assessing Bill 179 against
ILO standards.   Even though it is no longer in effect, apart from some
residual matters remaining for technical purposes, there is still a strong
divergence of views in the province as to its nature and effect.   In addition,
it has been suggested that some practices introduced by the legislation
will continue to operate as a result of informal administrative action.
This point, too, has to be considered.

	145.	Bill 179 was enacted to counter rising inflation.   Its effect, put
generally, was to impose a fairly rigid control of wages in the public
sector.   This was built around a "control year" with a limit of a 5 per
cent increase.   This was embedded in less severe controls which could
be effective as a 9 per cent ceiling.   The whole exercise could affect
a particular bargaining unit over a two-year period.   It was suggested
that the Government had failed to establish that there was in fact an economic
crisis.   There had been insufficient research and understanding of the
problem.   It was also said that wage increases would have fallen year
by year without legislative interference.   Both these beliefs are of course
matters of opinion.   The basic data is not seriously in dispute.   There
is a marked difference of interpretation between the trade unions who made
these points and the Government.   It was suggested that such divergence
of view should be resolved by some independent mechanism, such as the courts.
It is difficult to see the necessity in principle for such a fetter upon
the exercise of the political will.   There is every opportunity for the
matters concerned to be tested through debate in the political forum.

	146.	Since the public sector was being singled out for special control,
on the assumption that wages in the private sector would follow the trend
set, it does seem essential that there should be ample time allowed for
consultation.   Failure to do this might indicate that the action was indeed
precipitate and partisan.   There was no complaint about lack of consultation.
What was said was that the views of the trade unions had no discernible
effect on the attitude and actions of the Government.   That is a different
matter.

	147.	So far, these remarks relate to the political aspects of the concern
expressed.   The actions do raise, however, practical and
legal considerations.
The most obvious is the impact the legislation had upon existing collective
agreements.   They were subject in many cases to amendment in particular
a lesser wage increase being allowed.   A lawyer can characterise such
action as the expropriation of rights.

	148.	Such a result is difficult to avoid where a scheme of restraint is
imposed which it is intended should have a speedy effect.   The Government
was aware of the problem and chose to apply what it regarded as "rough
justice".   Indeed attention was paid to attempting to mitigate some of
the consequences.   Most notable was some degree of protection of the first
agreement, that is to say, the first agreement made after a trade union
has secured bargaining rights.   Such agreements often involve substantial
improvements in terms and conditions.   This was recognised by the leglisation
and the impact of the 5 per cent delayed to allow the first agreement to
operate.

	149.	Despite these concerns, the legislation appears to have had a greater
impact on free collective bargaining than was intended or anticipated.
Three aspects of this appear to be particularly important:  the "chilling
effect" on collective bargaining generally, damage to policies being pursued
by the trade unions from bargain to bargain and the machinery for certification
during the so-called "open" period.

	150.	Although the legislation applied only to monetary items it seems
to have had an effect on matters not covered by the Act on which the parties
were free to bargain.   In part this was made more likely because there
had been the anticipation of a switch of bargaining to non-monetary items.
Some steps had been taken to prevent this being used to undermine the
intended financial control.   There can be little doubt that there were
items adversely affected, health and safety issues spring to mind.   Now
the problem can be seen in the light of experience;  it can be tackled
should such a need arise in the future.   Particular attention should be
paid to the availability of the disputes resolution mechanisms so that
normal relations can continue hampered only by the minimum of restrictions
needed to secure the objects of the emergency measures.

	151.	The general objectives which the trade unions in the public sector
were pursuing and which suffered setbacks are, for example, remedying low
pay and seeking equality for women.   Both objectives are legitimate, indeed
praiseworthy.   There can be no doubt that Bill 179 constituted a check
to their progress.   Most obvious is the use of a norm for pay increases
expressed as a percentage, rather than as a flat increase.   The Government
accepts that this consequence occurred and points out that some steps had
been taken to mitigate the result.   Some of the provisions did seek to
give special advantages to the lower paid:  the highest were to some extent
held back.   Whether enough was done is in dispute.   Recognition of the
need to take into account such considerations when legislation is being
prepared seems to be accepted.   This seems to be an important point.

	152.	The third example of the wider effects of the legislation concerns
the "closing" of the "open" period which is a feature of the Canadian industrial
relations system.   The legislation purported to close the open period
of the control year.   This was thought to deny the unions the right to
gain certification.   The matter was taken to the courts.   Again, it is
clear that the object of the provision was to secure as much industrial
relations tranquility as possible during the restraint period.   The question
raised is whether such action was convenient and useful rather than necessary.
It would need detailed knowledge of what the precise effect was during
the operation of Bill 179 but
prima facie
the limitation appears to seek
to avoid disturbance rather than secure an essential component of the limitation
plan.

	153.	Attention was drawn to the Broadway Manor case and two comments might
be useful.   The decision was that the open period was not in fact closed
- a distinction being made between terms and conditions which were continued
and the collective agreement which did not.   The decision turned of course
on the precise wording of the provisions of Bill 179.   In that it has
narrow interest, but wider considerations arise.   The case shows the importance
of prior discussion of all the possible consequences of proposed legislation,
that is to say, of consultation.   What is decided then will be effective.
On the other hand, reliance on the courts to clarify or interpret the
legislation may bring changes but these will almost invariably prove ineffective
since the decision is unlikely to be available during the currency of legislation
which is short term.   Consultation not only on the wider issues - should
a provision be enacted - may merely lead to reaffirmation of the policy
proposed but, on the practical consequences, what exactly is likely to
happen might lead to sensible modifications being adopted.

	154.	One of the clearest and most important points put to us by the various
trade unions was the impact the legislation has had on the regular industrial
relations machinery.   Various examples were given.   It was felt that
the employer, where his financial ability to meet trade union claims was
severely limited by government fiscal policy, was unable to bargain with
freedom.   The scope of his flexibility might vary but his attitude was
significantly altered.   There were some signs of this in some of the instances
put but there was too little information to enable the position in the
Province of Ontario to be confidently assessed.

	155.	The problems the legislation and subsequent practice have posed for
the important component of the system, independent arbitration, are much
clearer and were put forward with much greater force.   During the period
when Bill 179 operated on collective bargaining, of course norms were in
effect substituted for arbitration.   Since then, under Bill 111, the idea
of a norm, or desirable maximum increase formulated by the Government has
continued.   Arbitrators are given quite specific indications of the Government's
view and are expected to take this into account.   There are widely differing
views on the effect of this practice, which
appears likely to continue.
It must be true that arbitrators will always have in mind the economic
background in which they are operating.   Many independent arbitrators
are academics but few live in such ivory towers, as is commonly supposed,
as not to have a clear awareness of these factors.   In the unlikely chance
of this being lacking, no doubt the parties will raise the issue in their
statements.   On the other hand, the publication to the arbitrator of a
norm may have some effect.   Again empirical evidence is less than clear
since, alas, it is not possible to assume that when an arbitrator says
he has "taken into account" such a figure, he is indicating that he has
or has not been greatly influenced by it.   There are ample instances of
the arbitrator expressing scepticism.   To balance this it appears that
several arbitrators have refused to act feeling that their freedom of action
was fettered.

	156.	The independence of arbitration is of paramount importance.  It is
the feature of the system in the public sector which seeks to balance the
non-existence of the right to strike.   That equation is one which not
all those giving evidence accept as fair or proper but that question does
not arise at this time.   What is important is that where that system operates,
arbitration must be independent.   Confidence in arbitration is easily
destroyed so everything must be done to ensure that doubts as to independence
should be assuaged.   It is not a question of testing or challenging their
validity.   It is essential to see whether steps can be properly taken
to strengthen independence.   One significant point put concerns the appointment
of arbitrators.   If at all possible, this should be done by a body independent
of Government, a Labour Relations Board, a court and so on, depending on
the particular structure.   It is a matter that would require serious consideration
by the provincial authorities.

	157.	Finally, it is necessary to note that the way in which these remarks
are to be interpreted depends very much on whether inflation restraint
secured by putting pressure on the public sector in particular is to continue.
It has already been noted that Bill 111 does not appear to have a successor.
Continuation of the policy, if at all, will be through administrative
and practical measures.   Experience indicates that they can play an important
part in the Government's policy.   If they do, since the method adopted
is informal, greater care will be essential to ensure that the damage to
industrial relations structures, especially the right to seek certification,
to bargain collectively and to enjoy truly independent arbitration, does
not occur.   The trade union apprehensions appear to run ahead of what
is happening - justifiably so.   Awareness of these fears and discussion
of the problems should help to avoid unwitting damage to the very vital
safeguards built into current Ontario legislation.

VI.  Case of Newfoundland:  No. 1260

A.
Introduction

	158.	This case has its origin in a formal complaint submitted, on 3 February
1984, by the Canadian Labour Congress on behalf of the Newfoundland Association
of Public Employees (NAPE) which belongs to the National Union of Provincial
Government Employees (NUPGE), an affiliate of the CLC.   The Government's
observations in response to the complaint were contained in a communication
of 29 May 1984.

B.
The issues

	159.	On 19 August 1983 an Act (known as Bill 59) was proclaimed the object
of which was to introduce amendments to the the Public Service (Collective
Bargaining) Act, 1973.   According to the CLC these amendments are in violation
of ILO Conventions Nos. 87, 98 and 151 in three different areas:  the definition
of "employee" contained in section 2(1) of the Bill, the designation of
"essential" employees (section 10), and the limitation placed on strike
action (sections 10(12), 23 and 24).   According to the CLC Bill 59 was
the latest in a series of restrictive anti-union enactments introduced
to control wages in the public service and limit the possibilities for
strike action.

	160.	The Government of Newfoundland explained that, between 1973 (when
the Public Service (Collective Bargaining) Act extended bargaining rights
to employees of the Provincial Government) and 1983, it had become obvious
that section 10 of the Act was not effective in that almost every application
before the Labour Relations Board had been found by either the Board or
the courts to be defective in some respect.   Section 10 clearly needed
to be amended to provide for the designation of essential employees whose
services were necessary for the health, safety or security of the public.
In addition, unions continued to apply to the Labour Relations Board
for inclusion in bargaining units of management and confidential employees
and, although the Board generally rejected these efforts, it was determined
that the Act should also be amended to remedy an oversight in the legislation
and explicitly state the exclusions.   According to the Government, no
amendments had been made to the basic Act prior to Bill 59.   Because of
preliminary discussions with various public service unions and concerns
expressed regarding three particular sections, the Act had been made subject
to proclamation.   The Minister of Labour had contacted each of the public
service unions and had invited recommendations to be submitted to the Government
regarding expressed concerns.   No concrete proposals or written submissions
were received by the Government and, accordingly, on 19 August 1983 the
amending Act was proclaimed to come into force on 1 September 1983.
(i)
	Exclusions from the definition
	of "employee"

	161.	The CLC maintained that the amended definition of "employee" had
resulted in the exclusion of more than 2,000 government employees from
membership of NAPE and prevented them from joining any other union.   This
group included justice department solicitors, legislative staff, middle
management and consultants and could exclude a number of employees who
currently had union membership with the bargaining agent that represented
provincial government employees, namely NAPE.   The complainant considered
as particularly offensive new section 2(1)(i)(xii) which specifically prohibits
people hired for programmes sponsored by Government grants and working
for the provincial government from joining a union;  it suspected that
the provincial government would use this subsection to lay off permanent
employees and hire non-union personnel to do the work of those laid off,
work which had traditionally been done by members of the bargaining unit
concerned.

	162.	In its written response to the complaint, the Government stated that
the amendments to section 2 had been necessary to prevent interference
by employers in trade union activities and to avoid conflicts of interest
involving management staff.   It pointed out that the exclusions described
in section 2(l)(i)(viii), (ix), (x) and (xi) concerned high-level employees
whose functions are normally considered as policy-making or managerial,
or employees whose duties are of a highly confidential nature as contemplated
in Article l.2 of Convention No. 151.   The Government stated that none
of these employees had been members of bargaining units at the time of
enactment of Bill 59, nor had the union involved ever made application
for inclusion in a bargaining unit of any of these categories of employees.
According to the Government, the exclusions provided for in section 2(1)(i)(xiii),
(xiv) and (xv) concern persons on whom the Labour Relations Board, and
not the Government, makes a determination as to the appropriateness of
inclusion in a bargaining unit.   These employees would be those who, in
the opinion of the Board, performed management or supervisory functions,
or were employed in a confidential capacity in matters relating to labour
relations.   In the past, in utilising these criteria the Board had taken
a fairly restrictive approach to exclusions from the bargaining unit.

	163.	The Government stated that section 2(l)(i)(xv) allows for the exclusion
of employees who, in the opinion of the Board, provide advice to the employer
in relation to the development or administration of policies or programmes
and that it was senior consultants who were intended to be excluded from
the bargaining units under this provision.   Although these employees might
not be supervisors in the normal sense of the word, or have access to confidential
labour relations information, according to the Government they did form
an essential part of the senior management team in many government organisations
and were therefore clearly inappropriate for inclusion in a bargaining
unit.   The Government emphasised that there
had been no decisions by the
Labour Relations Board interpreting this provision to date.

	164.	As regards section 2(l)(i)(xii) the Government stated that this was
an amendment to deal with a unique situation concerning which there had
been a written agreement with the union concerned, namely that of individuals
receiving social assistance from the Provincial Government, with the aim
of helping them to become self-sufficient by introducing them to the workforce
and of qualifying them for unemployment insurance benefits.   The Government
explained that many of these individuals had no work experience or job
skills, thus making it virtually impossible for them to obtain employment
in difficult times;  they were placed throughout the province with a variety
of employers, many in the private sector, in order for them to learn a
skill or gain some experience so that they might find a job in the future;
they were not employees in the true sense of the word since they were
not required to report for work, and, if they did not, they simply returned
to social assistance;  the Government paid their wages and employment was
for a specified period of time.   The Government pointed out that the union
had agreed that these individuals would not be required to pay union dues
and would not be covered by collective agreements.   However, in May 1983,
the union refused to honour its agreement, which had led to the introduction
of this legislative amendment.   The Government maintained that it was
clearly inappropriate for normal union hiring and recall provisions to
apply to this type of unique programme;  if this had been the case, the
programme would have been significantly impaired, if not rendered inoperable,
causing hardship for many needy people.

	165.	The Government's final point concerning the definition of "employee"
under the amended Act was that the excluded employees did enjoy freedom
of association and the right to organise.   Neither did Convention No.
87 nor Convention No. 98 impose an obligation on Government to grant certification
rights for the purpose of collective bargaining.   Excluded employees were
able to organise and negotiate their conditions of employment collectively,
often on an informal basis, and often on a formal basis when the Government
had voluntarily recognised certain associations and bargained with them
on behalf of their membership, e.g. Newfoundland and Labrador Association
of Superintendents of Education and the Newfoundland Medical Association.

(ii)
Designation of "essential" employees

	166.	As regards the amendment to section 10 of the Act which defines the
method of designating essential employees, the complainant cited the restrictions
contained in subsections 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8.   Subsection 1 empowers the
employer of employees in a bargaining unit to provide the provincial Labour
Relations Board with a statement in writing as to the number of employees
whom it considers to be essential.   Under subsection 2, where no objection
is made to this statement before the Board the number of employees specified
shall be deemed to be the number of essential employees;  where an objection
is
made to the written statement before the Board, under subsection 3,
the Board after considering the objection and affording the bargaining
agent and employer an opportunity to make representations and to be heard
shall determine the number of employees who are essential.   Once this
process is completed the employer, under subsection 7, shall name the employees
in the unit who are essential;  under subsection 8 the employer has the
right to substitute names.   According to the complainant, subsection 1
allows the employer to make a statement at any time to the Board on the
number of employees it considers essential, there being no restrictions
as to the number of times that the employer can make that statement.
This permits the employer to participate in strike-breaking activities
because, for example, an employer could designate few employees as essential
in the initial stages of a strike and designate more and more employees
as essential as the strike progressed so as to make strike action pointless.
In addition, the combination of subsections 2, 3 and 7 of section 10
enables employers to determine that only some employees in a classification
are essential while certain other employees performing exactly the same
duties need not be declared essential.

	167.	The complainant alleged another discriminatory element in the process
of designating essential employees under Bill 59:  the Labour Relations
Board was now restricted from operating in an independent manner because,
under section 10(3), it could not increase the number of essential employees
from the figure that was contained in the employer's statement.   For example,
when an employer designated 49 per cent of bargaining unit members as essential,
for all practical purposes strikes were outlawed, and employees were prevented
from taking their case to arbitration under the Act because a majority
was necessary for such action.

	168.	According to the complainant section 10(12) also violated the rights
of public sector workers;  it provides that a strike vote cannot be taken
until any dispute involving the determination of essential employees is
settled.   Thus even the polling of a union's members to get an indication
of the feelings towards strike action is prohibited.

	169.	The complainant stated that the most repressive feature of the amendment
to the designation of essential services employees was the fact that employees
who had been deemed essential lost all their rights with respect to employment
- they were not covered by a collective agreement and they were not covered
by the basic labour standards legislation.   In addition, section 10(11)
allows the employer to terminate immediately the employment of an essential
employee who fails to report to work, without that employee having access
to any appeals procedure.   Subsection 11 reads as follows:  "Where an
employee named by the employer as an essential employee does not report
for work as required under subsection 10, the employer shall forthwith
terminate the employment of that employee, unless the employer is satisfied
that there are reasonable grounds for the employee not so reporting".

	170.	In its written observations on the question of essential employees,
the Government stated that the 1973 Act did not take away the right to
strike from any particular group of employees, but only from those individuals
in any given bargaining unit which the Labour Relations Board might determine
were necessary for the health, safety or security of the public.   The
Government stated that the 1973 version of section 10 had not achieved
its purpose since the unions effectively thwarted the Government's applications
to the Board for a determination of essential employees.   At first, few
strikes had taken place in areas affecting the health, safety or security
of the public and those that had taken place were of relatively short duration;
emergency services could be provided by management employees and, in some
cases, the unions had allowed some bargaining unit members to work in emergency
situations.   The situation changed, however, in 1981 when the laboratory
and X-ray employees took strike action.   According to the Government,
the union provided emergency services but not essential services, emergency
services being provided only in cases where there was an immediate threat
to life.   Management employees were able to provide additional services
so that for a period of time hospitals had been able to cope.   The strike
continued beyond a month's duration and difficulties arose, forcing the
Government to act by introducing Bill 111 which provided for the designation
of approximately one-third of the bargaining unit to provide essential
services.   This Act had been repealed with effect from the date of signing
a new collective agreement to cover laboratory and X-ray employees and,
in any case, on the date of the enactment of Bill 111, the union had called
off the strike.   Following the conclusion of this difficult situation,
the Government had decided that the 1973 Act would have to be amended to
provide a workable method of designating essential employees by an independent
tribunal prior to a strike.   Therefore Bill 59 introduced new essential
employee provisions;  employees could strike but essential services would
have to be maintained.   The Government explained that, under the amendment,
the Labour Relations Board determined the number of employees in any particular
classification that was required to provide essential services.   This
determination was based on the submission from the employer and provided
for intervention by the bargaining agent.    After the union and the employer
had agreed, or the Board had determined the number of employees, the employer
named the individuals and might substitute those names.   This was necessary,
stated the Government, so that the employer might choose employees who
could do the required work since employees in the same classification might
be somewhat specialised, e.g. critical-care staff or general day nurses.
It also allowed the employer to substitute names of employees who had
resigned, retired or taken leave of absence.

	171.	Regarding the allegation that the Labour Relations Board was now
prohibited from operating independently, since it could not increase the
number of essential employees contained in the employer's statement, the
Government stated that it or the employer, and not the Labour Relations
Board, had to determine the level of service which had to be provided to
ensure that the health, safety or security of the public was not jeopardised.
It claimed that there would be a
dereliction of public duty if the employer
were to seek a lower number of employees than reasonably necessary to perform
the required level of service.   It pointed out that where the number of
employees deemed essential exceeded 50 per cent, the bargaining unit had
the right to advise the employer and the Board that every employee would
be deemed essential, and thus the right to compulsory binding arbitration
was available to the bargaining agent pursuant to section 29 of the Act.

	172.	The Government stated that, under section 10(12), strikes and strike
votes which led to strikes were not permitted until the number - not the
names - of essential employees had been agreed between the parties or determined
by the Board.   The employer could not delay the determination of the number
of essential employees unilaterally since section 10(1) allowed the union
to request the Labour Relations Board to order the employer to make the
necessary submissions.   The Government emphasised that section 10(12)
did not prohibit the union in any way from polling its members to ascertain
their feelings towards job action;  it merely provided that a strike vote
leading to a strike pursuant to section 23 could not be taken prior to
a determination of essential employees.   According to the Government,
this was similar to a provision which stated that a strike vote could not
be taken until conciliation proceedings have been completed.

	173.	The Government maintained that employees who were named essential
and reported to work did not lose all their rights with respect to employment.
Section 10(10) provided that they must report to work as if a strike
were not taking place, which meant that the provisions of the expired collective
agreement continued to govern essential employees.   The essential employees
who worked through a strike were automatically entitled to all benefits
that the striking employees were able to obtain upon settlement of the
strike.   In addition, the Government repeated that, if more than 50 per
cent of the employees in a bargaining unit were deemed essential, all employees
had the right to binding arbitration.   As regards the allegation that
because of the designation of essential employees, strike action would
prove a useless tool, the Government stated that this was a premature statement
in view of the fact that no orders had yet been issued by the Board.
The Government also pointed out that an essential employee who failed to
report to work without reasonable grounds was subject to termination, but
since the expired collective agreement continued to govern essential employees
who were not on strike, the grievance provisions likewise remained in effect.
Employees were always subject to dismissal for just cause and the legislation
merely stated that failure to report to work without a valid excuse would
be just cause.   The employer's action and the employee's reasonable grounds
would continue to be subject to the scrutiny of arbitrators and the courts.
(iii)
Limitations on strike action

	174.	The third amendment introduced by Bill 59 which was the subject of
the complaint concerned section 23, which now provided that employees who
opt for strike action are required by law to give 38 days' (one month plus
seven days) notice before they are legally able to strike.   In addition,
section 24 of the Act had been amended so that workers in health care institutions
did not have the right to strike on a rotating basis.   According to the
complainant, sections 23 and 24 as they now read served no other purpose
than to limit union members in their freedom to express themselves, as
well as the right to strike to a particular means of striking.   It pointed
out that the employer, when drafting the legislation, had decided to attack
solely the union since the legislation did not provide for any reciprocal
provisions concerning the employer, such as lock-out.

	175.	Concerning the limitation on strike action, the Government pointed
out that, under the 1973 Act, a seven-day notice prior to taking strike
action was required.   This provision had not been altered except that
where strike action did not commence on the notified date, a one-month's
delay was required before another notice was permitted.   The Government
explained that this provision had been included to prevent a union from
closing an institution, such as a hospital, without actually going on strike.
When a hospital was notified that a strike was to take place, operations
had to be significantly curtailed and the hospital was geared down to providing
only essential services whether or not the employees actually withdrew
their services.   The new provision required that the employees give the
institution an opportunity to return to operational status for a reasonable
period of time if they did not strike on the date originally intended.

	176.	Regarding rotating strikes, the Government stated that such action
in health service institutions had been prohibited so as to avoid a situation
where persons were admitted to hospital and scheduled for surgery and,
with no further notice, employees of that hospital went on strike.   Rotating
strikes in health service institutions created life-threatening situations
and, stated the Government, were completely unacceptable.   It pointed
out, however, that these two provisions covering the timing and nature
of strike action had no effect on the right to strike or the effectiveness
of job action once taken, but were reasonable limitations taken only in
the interests of protecting the health and safety of the public and did
not amount to an infringement of freedom of association.   The Government
considered that the allegation that the amendment did not include an accompanying
prohibition on rotating lock-outs is difficult to understand since such
action would never benefit health service institutions.

	177.	In conclusion, the Government stated that the amendments under examination
had been made to protect the health, safety and security of the public
and not intended to discriminate or interfere in lawful union activities.
It pointed out that the Committee on
Freedom of Association had recognised
that exclusion from trade unions and the collective bargaining process
of public servants occupying managerial or supervisory positions of trust
was justified.   The Government maintained that the amendment to section
2(1) had excluded such employees from a bargaining unit but left them free
to join associations to protect their occupational interests;  such associations
had been recognised by the Government and bargaining had taken place with
them.   As regards the other specific exclusions listed in section 2(1)(i)(viii)
to (xii) the Government stated that it had no control over such exclusions
since applications had to be made to the Labour Relations Board which made
decisions based on established precedent and labour law principles relevant
to exclusions from the bargaining unit.    It pointed out that, over the
past several years, most inclusions/exclusions in government departments
had been settled by agreement between the union concerned and the employer
with only a very few disputed positions being taken to the Labour Relations
Board for a determination.    As regards the allegation that the new method
of designating essential employees discriminated against union activists,
the Government stated that there had been no interference in union organisation
and no instances of an employee having to join or relinquish membership
in a trade union.   According to the Government it was in the employer's
interest to have employees who would perform essential services and it
was employer policy not to designate union executives and officials unless
they were the only individuals in the classification who were able to perform
the required work.   It reiterated that the amendments to the legislation
concerning the timing or nature of strike action were not unnecessary interferences
in the union's activities or programmes, but merely laid down preconditions
to the implementation of a strike.   It stated that the union was free
to poll its members and conduct ballots to determine the feeling of the
membership towards job action and that only the formal strike vote which
culminated in a strike might not be taken until essential employees had
been designated.

C.
Information obtained during the mission

	178.	I had extensive discussions on the issues raised in this case with
both the NAPE and the provincial government representatives, headed by
the Assistant Deputy Minister, on the spot in St. John's, Newfoundland
and in Ottawa where CLC and NUPGE representatives also spoke to me about
Bill 59.   Once again, the oral submissions of the parties were supplemented
by extensive written submissions, handed to me in St. John's.

	179.	The first point that emerged during these discussions was that the
healthy industrial relations climate which had reigned in the Province
since the 1950s had fallen to an adversarial one.   According to the union,
partly due to the recession, partly in over-reaction to an increasing radicalism
in certain civil service unions, and perhaps partly due to an aversion
on both sides to seek interest arbitration,
the Government interferred
in the collective bargaining process with Bill 59.   NAPE's view was that,
prior to Bill 59, responsibility for the decline in labour relations lay
as much with the unions because of their radicalism as with the Goverment
because of its paternalistic approach.   The unions, however, could not
be blamed for the "panic" of the Government in enacting Bill 59 which was
utterly pro-employer in character and which would only lead to a further
deterioration in labour relations.   The background to the introduction
of the legislation in Parliament evidences the misunderstanding between
the parties at present, a point which will be referred to further on in
this report.

(a)
	Consultations

	180.	The union stressed during our discussions that it had, in effect,
only been given one day's notice when the draft legislation was tabled.
There were no public hearings on the proposed amendments and NAPE had
been under the impression that Bill 59 as a whole was subject to proclamation
whereas only the three disputed areas (definition of employee, designation
of essential employees and the strike provisions) were held in abeyance
and gazetted at a later date.   NAPE claimed that Bill 59 had eroded any
previous trust that existed beween the parties and caused a situation of
confrontation.   According to the union, the reason for the introduction
of this legislation had been clearly a growing contempt by the Government
for the unions and their increasing strength as well as a lack of respect
for the unions' ability to represent the interests of their members.
The situation prior to Bill 59 had been satisfactory with 294 contracts
having been concluded.   The arbitration system and the selection of arbitrators
from a panel established by the Labour Management Co-operation Committee
had also been satisfactory.

	181.	The Government, on the other hand, explained that copies of the draft
amendments had been given to the union very shortly before they were tabled
in Parliament.   The difficulties with the basic collective bargaining
Act and with section 10 in particular had been discussed with NAPE representatives
on many occasions in the past.   The Government delayed proclamation of
the disputed parts of Bill 59 and informed the union that it wanted to
receive its suggestions on them.   However, according to the Government,
no written submissions were received;  only a general tape-recorded description
of the problems was handed in to the Ministry of Labour.   This the Government
took to be a lack of interest in face-to-face discussion.   The provisions
were then proclaimed and came into force on 1 September 1983.   The Government
could not explain why the union backed off at this juncture although it
recognised that it may had been due to the breakdown in the informal, co-operative
relations which the union had had with the Government as employer in the
past.
(b)
	The definition of employee

	182.	According to NAPE, in the amendment of section 2(1) in Bill 59 the
Government had effectively excluded up to 2,000 workers from union membership
which some had previously enjoyed.   NAPE was concerned with the exclusion
from the definition of employee of persons employed in an employment opportunity
programme administered by the provincial Government with its own and/or
federal monies (section 2(1)(i)(xii)).   The union pointed out that this
exclusion from coverage of the Act does not apply to similar programmes
administered by other levels of government such as school boards and municipalities.
It claimed that the aim of such programmes was not to train the unemployed
to enter the workforce, but to transfer them from the provincial payroll
to the federal payroll.   Since such persons could not join a union, it
was more difficult to negotiate increases in union members' benefits, and
the union felt threatened by this source of scab labour should strikes
occur and the possible reduction in working time of union members.  NAPE
was particularly suspicious of this provision given that it has made many
agreements with employers not covered by the Act (municipalities, the College
of Fisheries, private hospitals) allowing employment opportunity programmes
in workplaces where it represents workers.   From copies of such agreements
handed to me, it appeared that NAPE's only precondition for accepting non-union
workers in such workplaces was the protection of the job security and benefits
of its members.   The union's other concern with this provision - that
it denied these persons the right to join a union - was not related to
an earlier agreement NAPE had had with the Government concerning non-unionisation;
that agreement had only concerned persons on welfare.   According to NAPE,
when the Government started using these people in programmes, that understanding
fell.  Given that the union was prepared to represent these people on matters
not connected to their rates of pay which were set under the scheme, more
or less in line with the minimum wage, and would not expect them to pay
dues, it felt that the Government ought to have negotiated their situation
with NAPE instead of legislating them out of coverage under the Act.

	183.	The Government pointed out that the employment opportunity programmes
were designed to enable unemployed persons to accrue the 20 weeks' workforce
experience required for entitlement to federal unemployment benefits.
When NAPE's position on coverage of such persons for non-collective bargaining
items was put to the Government, there appeared to be further misunderstanding:
the Government stated that, in 1984-85, about 600 people had been involved
in the programmes and therefore not entitled to collective bargaining,
whereas the union had claimed that 2,000 had been without collective agreements.
Given the temporary employment of people in these unique programmes,
the Government found it hard to understand why the union would be interested
in recruiting these people for membership
per se
but did not express opposition
to this possibility.

	184.	As regards the exclusion contained in section 2(1)(i)(xv) (persons
providing advice to the employer in relation to policies or
programmes),
NAPE explained that the past practice of negotiations and Labour Relations
Board decisions had worked well when disputes - which were quite rare -
over this type of employee arose.   It feared that this amendment could
be stretched to include such persons as social workers or consultants.
It pointed out that the Labour Relations Board has refused to grant exemptions
for the present until judicial challenges to Bill 59 as a whole are completed.
The Government considered that it had only put into legislative form
the criteria of the Board's past practice, namely the exclusion of managerial,
confidential and policy-making employees.   It pointed out that this was
an exclusion specifically recognised in Article 1 of Convention No. 151.
I pointed out that the union's suspicion might have been the result
of a lack of communication as to the intent of this provision.

	185.	During these discussions on section 2(1), the Government also emphasised
that there was no hidden motive behind subsection (ix) - which excludes
solicitors and legislative counsel from the Act - and pointed out that
they do form associations and bargain collectively with the employer.

(c)
	Questions concerning the right to strike

	186.	Section 2 of the Amendment Act of 1983 (Bill 59) repealed section 10
of the Public Service (Collective Bargaining) Act of 1973 which related
to the designation of essential employees, that is to say "employees whose
duties consist in whole or in part of duties the performance of which,
at any particular time or during any specified period of time, is or may
be necessary for the health, safety or security of the public".   While
the definition of essential employees remained the same after the 1983
amendment, a number of issues arose from the further amendments introduced
by Bill 59 to the Act of 1973.

	187.	NAPE claimed that public-sector unions had always provided essential
services to protect the health, safety and security of the public.   It
was NAPE's belief, however, that the legislation was being used to give
the employer, the Government and the Newfoundland Hospital Association,
an advantage in collective bargaining.   NAPE representatives insisted
that they were fully conscious of the need to provide essential services
during labour disputes.   Bill 59, however, empowered the Labour Relations
Board to be final arbitrator with respect to essential services.   The
Board would always err on the side of caution in its decisions on essential
services, thus favouring the employer.   It was NAPE's contention that
the Board would not appoint more essential employees than the number requested
by the Government.   The result was the prevention of more than half of
any bargaining unit being designated as essential, thereby preventing in
turn a resolution of a dispute by arbitration;  it was obviously the Government's
intention to eliminate the right to strike, but also to prevent disputes
from being resolved through arbitration.

	188.	NAPE argued that it was difficult for the union to agree on the determination
of essential employees since the employer refused to give it information
on the total number of workers in bargaining units and their job classifications.

	189.	According to NAPE, the workers in liquor stores who had previously
been considered essential, had had their right to strike restored, whereas
the status of hospital food service workers had not changed, their right
to strike always having remained intact.   It was an anomalous situation
when health inspectors employed by the provincial Government were considered
essential but workers not working for the province but who prepared food
for a number of hospitals were not.

	190.	The Government, according to NAPE, had always been unwilling to settle
questions of essential employees through negotiation or by following alternative
disputes settlement procedures.   This question was one which had been
going on for years and the courts and the Labour Relations Board had decided
that the Government's approach had been impractical.

	191.	If, for example, through negotiations or by decision of the Labour
Relations Board, 33 per cent of hospital support staff were declared essential,
this would mean that out of a bargaining unit of 800, 265 would remain
at work.   To this latter figure would be added management and non-bargaining
unit workers and workers of other bargaining units.   In other words, a
major hospital, during a strike, could have more workers available than
during the peak annual leave period.   It was, in addition, the practice
in Newfoundland to recruit other workers to replace striking workers.
Hospital support staff had, therefore, lost their collective bargaining
rights through this procedure which, in addition, denied them any other
disputes settlement machinery.

	192.	Under Bill 59, employers could select essential employees as they
wished or otherwise manipulate strikes by making it difficult to deal with
a dispute if a large minority of workers were deemed essential and received
full pay and benefits while those on strike had their regular income interrupted.

	193.	Another aspect of the matter was the ability, according to NAPE,
of the employer to have a small percentage of the bargaining unit declared
essential and to return periodically to the Board for further increases
in that percentage.   Such a practice would have the effect of destroying
strikes.

	194.	NAPE agreed that the legislation had never been used by the employer
in this manner but claimed, nevertheless, that these advantages written
into the legislation had a prejudicial effect on the morale of the workers
and on the collective bargaining process.   The belief, shared by NAPE
and by the Government, is that there must be levels below which public
services should not be reduced, should
not be used, either by unions or
by government, to gain advantages in collective bargaining.

	195.	In NAPE's view, the question of essential services should be decided
through negotiation between the Government and the union, or decided by
an expert third party.   No one should gain any advantage and essential
services should be shared equally amongst the qualified members of the
bargaining unit.   Since the question of essential services destroys the
right to strike, any bargaining unit in which the question arises must
have an alternative disputes settlement procedure at its disposal.

	196.	NAPE also questioned the need of sections 27-29 of the Act which
provide for a declaration of a state of emergency during a strike where
such a strike would be injurious to the health or safety of persons, or
a group or class of persons, or the security of the province.

	197.	The union referred to one case concerning a strike in 1981, of laboratory
technologists, X-ray technologists, technicians, etc. following the failure
of the Government to accept the report of a conciliation board.   Although
a strike was declared, the union set up an essential employees system and
provided specialist skills, on a permanent basis.   A renewed offer by
the employer was refused by the union.   The Government introduced legislation
(Bill 111) declaring up to half the bargaining unit as essential, thus
putting an end to the strike.   In the view of NAPE, the Government could
have referred the issues in dispute to arbitration or returned to the negotiating
table.   Instead, by introducing legislation, it destroyed collective bargaining
for the unit concerned.   The union thereafter signed a collective agreement
and Bill 111 came to an end.

	198.	NAPE also argued that section 2(12) of Bill 59 denied union members
the right to vote to take strike action.   If the employer made an offer,
the only vote that could be taken would be one to accept it, otherwise
it would be illegal.   The designation of essential employees should follow
- and not precede - a decision to strike.

	199.	Another problem was that posed by section 23 of the Act, as amended
by section 6 of Bill 59.   Under the previous legislation of 1973, bargaining
units were required to give seven days' notice of any strike.   Under Bill
59, if the union did not go on strike on the date specified in the notice,
30 days had to elapse before a further notice of seven days could be given.
Again, in the view of the union, this was an attempt to control collective
bargaining to the advantage of the employer.

	200.	Section 24 of the 1973 Act was also amended by Bill 59 to prevent
rotating strikes which, in NAPE's view, should not be banned.   Here again,
this prohibition gave the employer great influence on the union's negotiating
strategy.   In addition, rotating
strikes would ensure that only a portion
of the hospitals in the province would be on strike at any given time.

	201.	In its submissions on the question of strikes, the Government explained
that the 1973 Act granted this right to all workers covered by it, i.e.
civil servants, hospital employees and vocational school instructors, with
the exception of those who might be designated as essential.   Prior to
Bill 59, the employer, at the time of certification of the union, made
an application to the Labour Relations Board for designation of a list
of named employees.   Almost every such application had been contested
by the union and in some way found wanting by the courts which themselves
said that the Act required substantial modification on this question.
Even on one occasion, when the Board had appointed a panel of experts
to designate, the court had found that this panel did not have jurisdiction
to do so.

	202.	This unsatisfactory situation lasted for almost ten years and it
was only after the strike, in 1981, of laboratory and X-ray workers during
which a threat was made to call out even essential services, that amendments
were introduced in Bill 59.   As regards the 1981 strike, the Government
added that arbitration was not provided for in the legislation nor, from
an economic point of view, did the Government consider it appropriate to
refer the issues to arbitration.   Although the conciliation results  had
been rejected by the Government, it was often the union that rejected such
results.   In any event, the emergency legislation was enacted since there
was an urgent and grave risk to the health of patients.

	203.	The 1973 Act had, accordingly, proved to be unworkable as regards
essential services and Bill 59 had introduced amendments which were procedural
rather than substantial.   Instead of asking the Board to designate named
employees, a number was requested.   The employer could apply to the Board
at any time and not, as before, only at the time of certification, most
unions being in any event voluntarily recognised.   According to the Government,
the union's claim that the employer might make successive requests to the
Board in order to increase the number and thus break a strike was a misunderstanding
on its part.   Not only was it not the employer's intention to do this
but it was also practically impossible since there were major difficulties
in convening the Board at short notice.

	204.	According to the Government, there had been meetings with NAPE concerning
these problems but in spite of all the explanations given to them, the
misunderstanding remained.   No such problems, however, existed between
the employer and other bargaining units, e.g. the Canadian Union of Public
Employees, on these matters.   Agreements as to the designation of essential
employees had been reached with other unions, but NAPE who had knowledge
of the employer's current proposals, had requested the Board not to proceed
with hearings on them.   The Government supplied the mission with detailed
information on the recommendations it had made to the Board as to the percentage
of essential employees that might be fixed by the Board.   Since 1983,
however, NAPE had steadfastly refused to participate in the process of
negotiating essential employee requirements.

	205.	It was important to emphasise, continued the Government, that in
June 1985, section 10 of the Act was amended and a significant number of
Government employees in nine specific bargaining units were excluded from
the designation of essential requirement.   Other government agencies or
boards had identified a minimal or no essentials requirement and, in the
overall government sector, it had been determined that 21 per cent (17.7
per cent including section 10 units) of the employees were essential.
This group included 100 per cent of prison warders (who now had automatic
access to arbitration) and others such as forest-fire suppression crews,
social workers, etc.   The requirement in the health-care sector was greater
(33 per cent) to ensure a minimum standard of care for the sick and the
aged.

	206.	The Govermment pointed out that five years ago the union would not
have been prepared to accept arbitration as an alternative to its right
to strike.   Now it was the Government which, in the present economic situation,
was reluctant to seek arbitration.  Bill 59, the Government insisted, resulted
from court decisions and was precipitated by the 1981 strike.   Now, the
Government pointed out, the rules were set and well known and this was
preferable to the adoption - as was the case in 1981 - of emergency legislation
in the event of a strike in an essential service.   There had been no strikes
in the hospital sector since 1981.

	207.	As regards sections 23 and 24 of the Act, as amended by Bill 59,
the amendments introduced in June 1985 had repealed section 23 but had
maintained the seven-day notice period in respect of hospitals and health-care
institutions.   If workers in these sectors did not go on strike on the
date specified in the notice, a further 30 days had to elapse before another
notice was given.   The reason for this was to deal with the problem of
sending patients home and bringing them back to hospital if the strike
did not occur.   The system did not exclude eleventh-hour bargaining and,
in the view of the Government, there was no reason why there could not
be an agreement between the parties to extend by one day the seven-day
notice period if a new offer was made.

	208.	Concerning rotating strikes, the Government explained that Bill 59
had amended section 24 of the Act to prohibit such strikes in health service
institutions only.   The Act concerned the bargaining unit only, and while
part of that unit could be called out on strike, there could be no question
of that part striking on a rotating basis.   This provision had been introduced
to avoid the kind of problem that had been experienced during the 1981
strike of laboratory and X-ray workers.

D.
Concluding remarks

	209.	Public servants represented by NAPE basically retain the right to
strike.   The counter-inflation measures overrode the bargaining system
which remained intact for use once the special legislation had run its
course.   The complaint, therefore, relates to limitations which appear
to have recently been introduced into the usual process of bargaining.

	210.	The first point raised, and it is a very important one, was that
the measures in Bill 59 were never the subject of proper consultation.
It is obvious to an outsider coming to Newfoundland that, although industrial
relations in the public sector are not without their share of problems
and some strife, there has been a good relationship between the trade union
and government.   This did not prevent disharmony on Bill 59.   It is difficult
to describe accurately the extent of consultation on Bill 59 since perceptions
differed.   Such contact as there was took place in an atmoshpere where
the Government, having recently reviewed industrial relations was determined
to seek revision built on experience.   Whilst the trade union viewed the
changes as a threat to its position, indeed it felt that the position had
not been adequately assessed and felt threatened by the provisions of the
Bill, some of which it found far from clear.   It appeared to NAPE that
a series of incidents over the previous few years had led to a somewhat
extreme reaction which did not reflect what was really to be anticipated.
The underlying confusion and suspicion were clear.

	211.	The Act has been in place now for some two years.   Misunderstandings
and hesitancies still exist.   It has to be noted that very recently some
important modifications have been made by an amendment Act of June 1985.
This serves to underline the need for a resumption of co-operative consultations.
It is still possible to detect divergent views on the meaning and intent
of various provisions of Bill 59:  several practical difficulties can be
foreseen and both sides are looking predominantly at the possiblity of
extreme reactions from the other.   This is surely fruitful ground for
consultation and it would seem that there is scope for jointly clarifying,
tidying up and more closely defining the rules and, in the process, re-establishing
a better working relationship.

	212.	One of the most serious points put by the union relates to the limitation
on collective bargaining by amendments to the definition of employee.
This has two components.   Section 1(b)(xii) excludes from the crucial
definition of employee, those employed in an opportunity employment programme.
There was some confusion between the accounts given as to the exact coverage
of this subsection.   What is clear is that it excludes workers offered
opportunity placements from bargaining units.   This is understandable
since the principal terms and conditions are governed by the terms of the
scheme.   However two worries remain.   The trade union seeks the right
to be consulted on such workers who are used in work within or connected
with the bargaining unit.   There also appears to be no reason why such
workers could not be admitted as members with limited or notional dues
so that residual services other than bargaining could be provided.   The
second provision to which objection is raised in that of advisers to the
Government in the development or administration of policies or programmes
to be determined by the Labour Relations Board.   This subsection, it was
agreed, enshrined what had been the practice.   It is illustrative of the
lack of understanding that both agree on this, yet the trade union has
a suspicion that some change was intended.   Only an open dialogue can
remove such apparent misunderstandings.

	213.	Most complicated and central to the complaint are the changes made
by Bill 59 to the concept of essential employee.   The bargaining units
concerned include for example, hospitals and air traffic controllers.
Although there have been few strikes the Government has sought in the
Bill to give added protection to essential services.   The trade union
in almost all cases has offered "emergency personnel".   There is a discrepancy
in thinking as to what this should cover which is epitomised by the use
of different words - "emergency" and "essential".   The process of designating
a proportion of each bargaining unit as essential has ground to a halt.
The figures suggested by the Government have been made knowing the Labour
Relations Board has power of decision.   Two difficulties arise.   The
trade union challenges some of the numbers which, it appears, have been
selected with a liberal eye.   It fears the Labour Relations Board will
be unable to look at such an issue with rigour since the decision, possibly
affecting safety and health is an onerous one.   That should not be too
difficult to resolve.

	214.	Of much greater concern is the effect designation is likely to have
on strikes and it should be remembered that the right to strike is an important
feature of the relationships being considered.   If more than 50 per cent
of a unit are designated as essential then the right to strike is replaced
by independent binding arbitration.   Neither the Government nor the trade
union has a great liking for this mechanism.   None the less it is clear
that if a substantial proportion of the workers are designated as essential
then it becomes more attractive to the trade union than a weak strike.
As with so much in the complaint the issue cries out for study and compromise.
Unless some relaxation in the rules is made, those sectors where say
33-50 per cent are designated will fall between the two systems and trade
unions rights will be  restricted unacceptably.   The relationship between
designation of essential workers and the strike vote is a further point
raised.   Again there is a different view of how the system will work in
practice.   There appears to be a chance that designation of a proportion
outside the context of a strike, i.e. as a normal procedure, and of individuals
after the strike vote might go some way to alleviating the problem.

	215.	Two strike tactics have been dealt with by Bill 59.   Both have arisen
from isolated examples in the past and the provisions again appear to have
a degree of ambiguity.   The prohibition of a
strike where the stated date
has passed, for a period of 30 days, and fresh notice could be used to
delay a strike by last-minute bargaining.   There is no evidence that that
is intended, and a simple amendment, or even letter of intent, should remove
the genuinely held fear.   The provision against so-called rotating strikes
does appear to interfere with the trade union's power to determine how
it shall conduct a strike in the tactical sense.   Again the provision
gives rise to a justified fear but unless it is misused cannot be said
to be a serious fetter on action.

	216.	It will be obvious that the Government has looked at past practice
and has decided to prevent practices which were felt to be abuses of trade
union power that caused potentially difficult management problems in key
public sector areas.   This has led to a strong reaction and even stronger
suspicion.   The trade union has suggested, for example, that provisions
which appear at first sight to be enshrining useful and common practice
(such as section 18 allowing the Minister power to defer the statutory
process to introduce a conciliator or mediator) are devices that can be
used to defer or delay.   There can be no clearer example of the need to
clarify attitudes and intentions.   A relatively small number of agreements
or statements of intent on both sides would ensure that the possible use
of the legislation to damage or hamper the proper use of trade union power
would be accepted as not being the intention of the legislation.

	217.	The Committee on Freedom of Association will appreciate that the
purpose behind the legislation has been left unclear since it can be used
in several instances with differing results.   One interpretation would
seriously limit the right to strike effectively using normal criteria.
If this is to be a possibility the underlying basis of the system could
be in jeoparady.   It has to be remembered that the usual formula in the
public sector is that if the right to strike is withdrawn, the alternative
protection in these special cases is access to independent binding arbitration.
Where the right to strike exists but is seriously fettered or put in
jeoparady, then the workers concerned lack effective protection.

	218.	It is important that the exact meaning and possible uses of the provisions
of Bill 59 are clarified.  This will undoubtedly lead to some adjustments
- it was pleasing to hear that the 1985 Bill has already started that process,
albeit unilaterally.   Once this process is complete it will be necessary
to see whether the right to strike, with reasonable limitations to protect
the health, welfare and safety of the people, exists.   Where it does not,
alternative protection will be required.

VII.
Final remarks

	219.	Three of the complaints arise as a reaction to recently enacted legislation
in Alberta (Case No. 1247) - Bill 44, in Ontario
(Case No. 1172) - Bill
179 and in Newfoundland (Case No. 1260) - Bill 59.   The fourth, Alberta
(Case No. 1234), is a much narrower point.   Although the industrial relations
system varies from province to province, in some respects markedly so,
and although the three pieces of legislation take differing approaches,
there is a strong underlying similarity of policy and aims.   It seems
appropriate therefore in these concluding remarks to draw the Committee
on Freedom of Association's attention to the underlying currents.

	220.	All three statutes were enacted as a result of the Government's need
to combat inflation.   All three applied to the public sector, that is
to say, direct employees of the Government and others employed by independent
bodies largely dependent upon government funding.   This special attention
had two prime causes.   The Government itself was the employer or had a
strong influence over the employer and it was felt that control of the
public sector was both necessary and would set the level for the private
sector.   Most of the queries raised on this belong to the economic debate.
What concerned the trade unions and must concern the Committee is the
damage such legislation has done to industrial relations, in particular
of course, in breach of the principles set out in the ILO freedom of association
Conventions (i.e. Conventions Nos. 87, 98 and 151).

	221.	Several major features merit attention.   The Canadian industrial
relations system has a structure that at first sight mirrors that developed
in the United States.   That is to say it is fairly closely regulated by
legislation.   However there is also a strong tradition of informal contacts
which have enabled the parties to reach voluntary agreements and to determine
a not insignificant part of the relationship.   It has been suggested that
this consultative process has been damaged.   Certainly the use of legislation
has given that impression.   One major problem is that the Government,
when it is using legislation in the public sector is at the same time carrying
out two functions.   It is the democratic government acting to protect
the economy but it is also the employer, altering the balance of its relationship
with the trade union.   This gives ample opportunity for confusion, misunderstanding
and a serious breakdown in internal relationships.   It is easy to overestimate
this since normal relationships tend to carry on in many spheres, but the
fear and suspicion were apparent in all three provinces.   Ironically it
can be said that the greatest need is the re-establishment of normal industrial
relations processes - consultation, conciliation and mutual understanding.

1.
	Inflation control

	222.	Whereas inflation control is an important task of government, a distinction
has to be made between short-term measures aimed at bringing a situation
under control, and a more permanent structure.   Action is taken under
the first head because a particular problem overshadows the system.   This
was the position in Alberta
where the economic decline was sudden and serious.
It applied with somewhat less force to Ontario and Newfoundland although
the economic problems in those provinces were clear.   The legislation
in Ontario had already lapsed.   In all three provinces, however, it is
the lasting effects of the legislation, or in the case of Ontario of practices
springing from the period of legislation, which have to be measured.

	223.	In each case there has no doubt been some lasting effect.   This
involves either changes in the structure of collective bargaining or influences
on the independent dispute resolution machinery which is the predominant
safeguard in Alberta and Ontario and plays a small part in Newfoundland.
It is an assessment of this damage which is crucial to these cases.

2.
	Consultation

	224.	Although the Canadian system of industrial relations operates legally
regulated bargaining procedures the importance of consultation remains.
This is particularly so where a government introduces proposed legislation
to amend the rules governing that system and to change the relative position
of the parties to the bargaining.   It has already been remarked that such
consultation is doubly important where the Government seeks to alter bargaining
structures in which it acts actually or indirectly as employer.   Time
available for consultation must be adequate.   Obviously it may be limited
by the urgency of action in face of economic problems.   Its effectiveness
can be reduced by the attitude taken by the trade unions concerned.   But
it is a truism that proposals should be openly discussed, clarified and
doubts, fears and misunderstandings resolved before legislation takes its
final form.   Otherwise suspicion grows and attention is diverted to lengthy
and often untimely challenges in the courts.

	225.	In Alberta the Government took the view that the rapid fall in economic
prosperity called for urgent action.   Consultation appears to have been
limited to a formal presentation of views to the legislature.   In Ontario
there appears to have been ample opportunity for consultation which does
not seem to have been used constructively.   In Newfoundland there has
been a long-established and strong commitment to consultation which had
been a valued feature of the relationship.   Unfortunately although there
was some consultation the usual relationship appears to have broken down
at least temporarily.

3.
	Public servants - bargaining
	and the right to strike

	226.	In most Canadian provinces, but not Newfoundland, the right to strike
is withheld and access to independent binding arbitration takes its place.
This only occurs in very limited circumstances in
Newfoundland.   To
ensure the integrity of the system it is essential that the bargaining
procedures are unfettered and that there is truly independent machinery
to settle disputes of interest that are not agreed in bargaining.   Most
of the details of the complaints, from all four cases, relate to one or
other aspect of this crucial balance.   If the balance is seriously destroyed,
leaving aside short-term economic intervention in time of emergency, then
the ILO principles on freedom of association are called into question.

(a)
	Collective bargaining

	227.	It is not necessary to draw the Committee's attention to every complaint
made of provisions that were felt to destroy the fair balance of collective
bargaining.   Equally it is only necessary to underline the common view
of governments that it has become important in times of economic stringency
to introduce into public sector bargaining factors which correspond to
the gloomy information a private employer is able to bring to the bargaining
table by way of declining profits and slim order books.

	228.	Several examples will suffice.   In Alberta a considerable number
of changes to the machinery of bargaining have been promulgated.   In Newfoundland
significant limitations in the bargaining units and in the participation
of members of those units in strikes have been enacted.   It is not an
easy task to assess the extent of the damage but trade unions point to
flexible provisions which give rise to fear of loss of effectiveness.

(b)
	Independent dispute resolution

	229.	This aspect is vital to a proper system.   All the provinces have
a Labour Relations Board that acts as an independent regulator and decision
maker within the system.   Although some suspicions of bias were mentioned
there is not a great deal of evidence to substantiate this.   Of more concern
is the position of binding arbitration.   Disliked at times by both sides,
it remains the crucial keystone to the alternative pattern of no strikes
- independent dispute resolution.

	230.	Arbitrators have a notoriously short professional life, and their
decisions often give one side the view, almost invariably erroneous, that
the arbitrator lacks independence.   There is no doubt that in times of
economic stringency the pressures increase.   Governments resent a system
which passes control of financial decisions to a third party.   They naturally
tend to attempt to influence the arbitrator.   Asking that the economic
background be taken into account seems inevitable and sensible.    Insisting
on conformity to a norm destroys independence.   In practice the pressure
tends to lie between these extremes.   It is essential that care be taken
to protect independent arbitration:  both the mode of their appointment
and their tenure must be carefully regulated.   The system
inevitably,
however reluctant the parties may be, insists that arbitrators  be trusted
to act fairly and sensibly.

	231.	Finally it has to be stressed that a large number of the grounds
on which these complaints have been raised could be settled, not easily
it is true, by agreement between the governments and the trade unions.
Until they are, the tendency will be to use legislation, powers and practices
which damage the essential balance enshrined in ILO Conventions.   How
far that has occurred is not a matter for me:  the detailed information
above is intended as material on which the Committee on Freedom of Association
reach its decisions.

	232.	In concluding this report, I wish to express my sincere appreciation
to the Government of Canada and to those of the Provinces of Alberta, Ontario
and Newfoundland for the efficient and courteous manner in which my mission
was received and for the genuine spirit of co-operation in which the discussions
with the representatives of the various governments took place.   I also
wish to thank the Canadian Labour Congress, the National Union of Provincial
Government Employees, the Canadian Teachers' Federation and all the provincial
unions of public employees whose representatives were of the greatest assistance
to me throughout the mission.   A special word of thanks is due to Ms.
Lucille Caron, of the Federal Ministry of Labour, Mr. Brian Mallon of the
Canadian Labour Congress and Mr. Derek Fudge of the National Union of Provincial
Government Employees, who accompanied me at various stages of the mission
and whose valuable assistance regarding practical arrangements was much
appreciated.   Thanks is also due to Mr. John R.W. Whitehouse, Director
of the ILO Office in Ottawa who, along with his efficient staff, facilitated
practical arrangements.   Finally, I must express my deep indebtedness
to Mr. W.R. Simpson, Chief of the Freedom of Association Branch of the
ILO and Mrs. Jane Hodges also of that Branch, who accompanied me during
my mission to Canada.   Their mastery of ILO principles, deep understanding
of industrial relations, combined with their ability to work at speed,
were essential to the completion of my mission and this report.

Case No. 1285

COMPLAINT PRESENTED BY THE NATIONAL TRADE UNION
CO-ORDINATING BODY AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF CHILE

	156.	The complaint is set forth in a communication from the National Trade
Union Co-ordinating Body dated 7 May 1984.   The Government replied by
a communication dated 24 January 1985.

	157.	Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection
of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), nor the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

1.
	Physical attack on a trade union leader

	(a)
	The complainant's allegations

	158.	The complainant alleges that Mr. Clotario Blest, the founder of the
National Association of Public Employees (ANEF) and of the Unitary Confederation
of Workers (CUT), was the victim of a physical attack in May 1983.   The
attack was perpetrated the day after the leader had participated in the
meeting at which the National Command of Workers was formed, bringing together
the principal national trade union organisations of the country.

	(b)
	The Government's reply

	159.	The Government states that at the time it deeply regretted the physical
attack made on Mr. Clotario Blest, the founder of the National Association
of Public Employees (ANEF).   The aide-de-camp of the President of the
Republic had therefore visited Mr. Blest's home in order to convey to him
the personal feelings of the President of the Republic and his interest
in the victim's health.

	(c)
	The Committee's conclusion

	160.	The Committee observes that neither the complainant nor the Government
has indicated who is thought to be responsible for the alleged attack or
what form it took.   In these circumstances, the Committee does not consider
that it is in possession of sufficient information to express an opinion
on the matter.

2.
	Allegations concerning detention

	(a)
	The complainant's allegations

	161.	The complainant organisation makes the following allegations:

-
On 9 June 1983 Mr. Roberto Arredondo, the national leader of the Bahía
Employees' Federation and Chairman of the Regional Council of the Democratic
Union of Workers (UDT) at Concepción, was detained for several hours by
carabineros
and accused of carrying invitations to the protest called by
the National Command of Workers.

-
On 10 June 1983 officials of the Police Department detained at Rancagua
Marcos Molina, first director of the El Teniente area organisation and
treasurer of the Caletones Industrial Trade Union, and Arturo Vera, first
director of the Sewel y Mina Trade Union.

-
Eduardo Sepúlveda, national leader of the "Peasant Triumph" National
Confederation of Agricultural Workers, and José Morales, President of the
Talca Provincial Federation of that organisation, were detained at Talca.
Both arrests took place on 11 June 1983.

-
In July 1983 Mr. Diego Lebitum, the secretary of Establecimientos Savory
Trade Union No. 2, and Mr. Guillermo Saavedra Pinto, a member of the Union,
were arrested while they were holding a peaceful public demonstration in
the course of a legal strike called by their union.

-
In October 1983 Rodolfo Seguel, Eugenio López, Manuel Rodríguez, Eduardo
Díaz, Juan Meneses and Enés Zepeda, the trade union leaders of the "El
Teniente" copper mine, were detained for several hours for holding a peaceful
demonstration.

-
Three workers were detained in October 1983 for carrying placards at
a peaceful demonstration by 40 persons who were protesting at having been
dismissed en bloc from their work at the Club de la Unión.

-
In December 1983 Hernol Flores, the President of the ANEF, was detained
for distributing leaflets on the public highway.

-
In December 1983 three leaders of the Youth Department of the National
Trade Union Co-ordinating Body were detained for reading a greeting to
Raúl Alfonsín, the President of Argentina, in front of that country's Embassy
in the capital.

-
In March 1984 Manuel Bustos, the President of the National Trade Union
Co-ordinating Body, and Sergio Troncoso, President of the Confederation
of Building Workers, together with other persons,
were detained for heading
a peaceful protest march demanding the release of José Ruiz Di Giorgio.
	(b)
	The Government's reply

	162.	With reference to the alleged detention of Mr. Roberto Arredondo,
the trade union leader, the Government states that it has no information
on this matter.   From the tenor of the complaint, the detention would
appear to have been due to the carriage of pamphlets bearing instructions
for one of the so-called "peaceful protests" called by sectors in opposition
to the Government.   According to the complainants, however, the person
in question was then released.   The Government stresses the need for complainants
to furnish more information so that an answer may be given, for complaints
made in that way are lacking in seriousness.

	163.	With reference to the alleged detention of Mr. Marcos Molina Catalán
and Mr. Arturo Vera Mauro, the Government states that at about 2.20 p.m.
on 11 June 1983, as those persons were approaching a taxi loaded with leaflets
inviting participation in actions directed against the Government, they
were intercepted by officers of the Rancagua Police Department, who arrested
them and took them to the police station.   After interrogation at the
police station, where they spent six hours, they were released.   There
are no legal proceedings in progress against them at the present time and
both are at liberty.

	164.	With regard to the alleged detention of Eduardo Sepúlveda and José
Morales, the Government states that, "owing to the time that has elapsed,
it has not been possible to confirm these complaints".

	165.	With reference to the detention of Mr. Diego Lebitum and Mr. Guillermo
Saavedra Pinto, the Government states that, owing to the time that has
elapsed, it has not been possible to check the accuracy of this complaint.
If it was accurate, the matter was purely one for the police and obviously,
as has been explained in other cases, detainees are released once the police
have checked their identity and address.

	166.	With reference to the detentions which occurred in October 1983,
the Government states that, when a breach of public order is attempted,
the police, in discharge of their obligation to ensure the maintenance
of order and civic peace, proceed to arrest the perpetrators in order to
check their identify and address and, if the situation so warrants, summon
them to appear before the local police court which deals with offences
of this kind.   The cases mentioned by the complainant organisation did
not reach the stage of being heard by the competent local police court.

	167.	With reference to the detention of Mr. Hernol Flores, the Government
states that there is no record of his detention and that, since neither
the date nor the place of detention nor the authority which ordered it
are mentioned, the information is insufficient for
the purpose of verifying
the complaint.   As to the alleged detention of three leaders of the Youth
Department of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body, the Government
states that this complaint is based on a routine police operation.   A
group of persons obstructed the free movement of pedestrians and access
to the Embassy of the Argentine Republic at Santiago.   The police, in
the performance of their duty to maintain public order, disbanded this
unauthorised public meeting and, when the identity and addresses of those
responsible had been checked, they were released.   Consequently, the Government
continues, this complaint has nothing to do with freedom of association.

	168.	The Government states further that Mr. Manuel Bustos and Mr. Sergio
Troncoso were detained, together with five other persons, by
carabineros
on duty on the public highway on 22 March 1984 and taken to the First
Carabineros
Station.   The grounds for their detention were that, together with a group
of 50 persons, they went on a march through central streets with the Lawcourts
Building as their goal.   This procession was held without permission from
the authorities and in such a way as to cause obstructions to pedestrian
and vehicular traffic.   These persons were released immediately after
their identity and addresses had been checked and they had been summoned
to appear before the local police court for the offence presumed to have
been committed.

	(c)
	The Committee's conclusions

	169.	The Committee observes that, with reference to some of the alleged
detentions, the Government states that the lack of data from the complainant
or the lapse of time has made it impossible to verify the facts.   With
reference to other detentions, the Government has indicated that the facts
had nothing to do with freedom of association or that the persons concerned
had been held for several hours for the purpose of checking their identity
and addresses, questioning them and, where appropriate, summoning them
to appear before the local police court.

	170.	The Committee concludes that it is not in possession of sufficient
information to express a separate opinion on each of the alleged detentions.
The Committee wishes to point out, however, that the number of instances
in which trade union leaders and trade unionists are alleged to have been
detained and summonsed or questioned runs to about a score.   In these
circumstances, while observing that the allegations date back in most cases
to 1983 and that the persons in question are at liberty, the Committee
considers it useful to repeat that measures depriving trade union leaders
and trade unionists of their freedom on grounds related to their trade
union activity, even where they are merely summoned or questioned for a
short period, constitute an obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights.

3.
	Allegations concerning demonstrations

	(a)
	The complainant's allegations

	171.	The complainant organisation makes the following allegations:

-
In October 1983 a public demonstration by 70 trade union organisations
in the Plaza 11 de Septiembre at Valparaiso was violently prevented.
The repressive measures left several persons injured and 42 in detention.

-
In November 1983 the Administration at Rancagua withheld permission
for marches preparatory to an action proposed by the Workers' Provincial
Command of Cachapoal.   Similarly the Administration withheld permission
for an action by the same organisation in the place it had chosen.

-
On 14 December 1983 300 self-employed workers (itinerant vendors) were
subjected to brutal repressive action in the centre of Santiago and had
to seek refuge in Santiago Cathedral.   These workers, organised in the
Itinerant Vendors' Trade Union, in addition to suffering physical acts
of oppression, were subjected to an illegal scrutiny of their merchandise
and prevented from working in the streets of Santiago by a security force
composed of special squads of
carabineros
and civilians reinforced by dogs
specially trained to attack human beings.

-
In January 1984 a demonstration called by the National Trade Union Co-ordinating
Body was violently put down.
Carabineros
arrested 27 persons and left
about 10 injured.

	(b)
	The Government's reply

	172.	With reference to the allegations concerning the demonstration in
the Plaza 11 de Septiembre at Valparaiso, the Government states that this
accusation suffers from vagueness and cannot be verified owing to the time
which has elapsed.   Generally speaking, the Government points out that
the police force has the inescapable duty of maintaining public order and
keeping the civic peace and that, if a breach of public order has been
attempted, the police obviously has to intervene.   In such cases the persons
presumed to have been arrested, whose names are not given, are released
after their identity and addresses have been checked, unless they are summoned
to appear before the competent local police court.

	173.	The Government states further that the Regional Administration at
Rancagua withheld permission for marches owing to the problems they create
for pedestrian and vehicular traffic.   Furthermore the Workers' Provincial
Command of Cachapoal is not a trade union organisation and has no legal
personality, legal existence or known address.   Its presumed leaders are
not registered and it is not known who elected them or for how long.
It is a
de facto
body accountable to no one.

	174.	With reference to the alleged oppression of itinerant vendors, the
Government states that it has not been possible to confirm this complaint.
The Government points out that the police periodically dislodge and clear
out of the central streets of the city of Santiago a group of itinerant
vendors who set themselves up in the roadway and obstruct passers-by, because
these itinerant vendors hold no municipal permit or licence and pay no
taxes and because the goods they offer for sale are faulty and harmful
to the health and hygiene of the population.   For these reasons the police
expel them from the central area of the city.

	175.	With reference to the alleged violent suppression of the demonstration
called by the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body, the Government states
that this complaint cannot be answered because the exact date and place
of the occurrence and the names of the persons presumed to have been arrested
are not given.   With regard to the presumed detention of persons, the
Government states in general terms that, in the exercise of the inalienable
duty that vests in every authority in any country to maintain public order,
the police are empowered to arrest any persons who on the public highway,
in defiance of laws and regulations, proceed to perform acts and deeds
which may constitute some offence or punishable act.

	(c)
	The Committee's conclusions

	176.	The Committee observes that, with reference to two of the allegations,
the Government states that the complainants have not furnished enough information.
The Committee likewise notes that, according to the Government, the Administration
at Rancagua withheld permission for marches preparatory to an action proposed
by the Workers' Provincial Command of Cachapoal owing to the problems they
would create for pedestrian and vehicular traffic.   Lastly the Committee
observes that the Government has been unable to confirm the alleged oppression
of street vendors in the centre of Santiago, although it states that these
workers are periodically expelled from the central area by the police for
non-compliance with the administrative rules concerning safety, hygiene,
taxes, etc.   In these circumstances the Committee reiterates in general
terms that trade union rights include the right to organise public demonstrations.
Although the prohibition of demonstrations on the public highway in the
busiest parts of a city, when it is feared that disturbances might occur,
does not constitute an infringement of trade union rights, the authorities
should strive to reach agreement with the organisers of the demonstration
to enable it to be held in some other place where there would be no fear
of disturbances.

4.
	Allegations concerning violations of the internal
	autonomy of trade union organisations

	(a)
	The complainant's allegations

	177.	The complainant organisation makes the following allegations:
-
In June 1983 the Provincial Inspectorate of Labour at Santiago removed
Ricardo Lecaros, the Vice-President of the Metallurgical Confederation
(CONSTRAMET), from office for having been tried under the Act on the Internal
Security of the State.

-
In October 1983 the Provincial Directorate of Labour at Rancagua prevented
Rodemil Aranda and Marcos Molina, the present leaders, whose dismissal
is under review by the courts, from standing for election in the Caletones
Industrial Trade Union.   The same Provincial Directorate also suspended
the record of the election held in the Caletones Industrial Trade Union.

-
In October 1983 the Provincial Director of Labour at Rancagua requisitioned
the record books of the Caletones Industrial and Professional Trade Unions
and the Sewel y Minas Industrial and Professional Trade Unions in order
to place them at the disposal of the undertaking for use in support of
its case in the proceedings against Rodolfo Seguel.

	(b)
	The Government's reply

	178.	The Government states that Mr. Lecaros was sentenced for incitement
to illegal paralysis of national activities, an offence defined in the
State Security Act.   This meant that he did not meet the legal requirements
for appointment as a trade union leader, since section 21 of Legislative
Decree No. 2756 on the organisation of trade unions requires inter alia
that in order to be a trade union leader he should "not have been sentenced
for a crime or an offence punishable by a severe penalty or for an offence
relating to the administration of trade union property, or be currently
accused of one".   In these circumstances Mr. Lecaros was disqualified
for the performance of trade union functions.

	179.	The Government adds that, in virtue of the aforementioned law, a
person placed under a disqualification by decision of the Directorate of
Labour may appeal to the courts within a time-limit of five days.   According
to the Government, the information furnished in the complaint is insufficient
and it is necessary to know in what court and on what date the person concerned
appealed against the order of disqualification, so that more information
may be supplied.

	180.	With reference to the allegations concerning Mr. Rodemil Aranda and
Mr. Marcos Molina, the Government states that these workers could not stand
for election as trade union leaders because they were not workers of the
undertaking and proceedings brought by the same persons were pending before
the Second Court at Rancagua petitioning that the measure discontinuing
their contracts of employment adopted by the "El Teniente" Division of
CODELCO-Chile should be declared null and void.

	181.	With reference to the suspension of the record of the election held
in the Caletones Industrial Trade Union, the Government states that the
labour inspectors, in their capacity as authenticating
officers, were checking
the election on the premises of the trade union when they were notified
of a decision of the Court of Appeals at Rancagua directing that the election
record should be suspended for such time as the proceedings against three
leaders were pending.   The election eventually took effect on 29 January
1984 after this had been authorised by the Court of Appeals at Rancagua.

	182.	Furthermore the Government states that it is not true that the record
books of the Caletones Industrial and Professional Trade Unions and the
Sewel y Minas Industrial and Professional Trade Unions were requisitioned.
In reality the labour inspector placed a copy of the Unions' records
at the disposal of the court for use as evidence in the interests of a
better decision in the proceedings.

	(c)
	The Committee's conclusions

	183.	The Committee takes note that, according to the Government, the record
books of the Caletones and Sewel y Minas Industrial and Professional Trade
Unions were not requisitioned but that the labour inspector placed a copy
of their records at the court's disposal for use as evidence in the interests
of a better decision in the proceedings against the leader Rodolfo Seguel.

	184.	The Committee observes that the other facts alleged arose as a result
of failure to meet the requirements laid down by law for appointment as
a trade union leader.   One case concerns the disqualification of a trade
union leader who was sentenced for illegally paralysing national activities;
in another case two leaders could not stand for election because they
were not workers of the undertaking, and in a third case the judicial authority
ordered the trade union elections suspended for such time as proceedings
were pending against three leaders.   The Committee wishes to point out
in this connection that, when national legislation provides that all trade
union leaders shall belong to the occupation in respect of which the organisation
carries on its activities, the principles of freedom of association may
be impaired.   In fact, in such cases, the dismissal of a worker who is
a trade union leader may, by causing him to lose his status as a trade
union officer, infringe the freedom of activity of the organisation and
its right to elect representatives in freedom, and may even leave the way
open for acts of interference by the employer [see Freedom of Association
and Collective Bargaining, General Survey by the Committee of Experts,
Report III (Part 4 B), ILC, 69th Session, 1983, para. 158].   Similarly,
a law which generally prohibits access to trade union office because of
any conviction is incompatible with the principles of freedom of association,
when the activity condemned is not prejudicial to exercising trade union
office with integrity.

5.
	Allegations concerning raids on trade union
	premises

	(a)
	The complainant's allegations

	185.	The complainant organisation makes the following allegations:

-
Arturo Martínez, the President of the National Graphic Confederation,
made an early application for
amparo
(enforcement of constitutional rights)
on 13 June 1983 as a result of a visit which
carabineros
paid to the Confederation's
headquarters, without producing a judicial warrant, for the purpose of
questioning the caretaker about the activities carried on by that leader.

-
In June 1983 the headquarters of the National Federation of Petroleum
Trade Unions at Santiago was raided.

-
In November 1983
carabineros
made an illegal and violent raid on the
headquarters of the Independent Building Workers' Trade Union No. 2 of
Maipú while the members and their families were holding a celebration there.
Gerardo Rodríguez, a member of the Union, was arrested in the raid and
later released without charges.   The
carabineros
threatened to interrupt
any other activity of the trade union in the same way.

-
In March 1984 a group of five persons armed with bludgeons and chains
made a night attack on the headquarters of the National Association of
Public Employees (ANEF).   This was the third attack on the headquarters.

	(b)
	The Government's reply

	186.	The Government states that it fails to see what connection the facts
alleged concerning the National Graphic Confederation can have with freedom
of association.   According to the Government, the fact that the person
presumed to be affected - who has never been arrested - has made an early
application to the courts for
amparo
shows that his rights are being properly
protected.

	187.	With reference to the alleged raid on the headquarters of the National
Federation of Petroleum Trade Unions, the Government states that it has
no information as to its having happened, and notes that there is no indication
as to who made the search, or why.

	188.	With reference to the alleged raid on the headquarters of the Independent
Building Workers' Trade Union No. 2 of Maipú, the Government states that
this trade union applied to the Court of Appeals at Santiago for protection.
On 9 December 1983 the Court ruled denying the application.   Those concerned
lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court, which also rejected it, and the
dossier was accordingly closed.

	189.	With reference to the alleged night attack on the headquarters of
the ANEF, the Government states that this is "purely a police matter outside
the Government's control".   In order to provide more information it would
have been necessary to know the date and, if applicable, the court before
which the charge was laid.

	(c)
	The Committee's conclusions

	190.	The Committee takes note of the Government's reply that it has no
information concerning the alleged raid on the National Federation of Petroleum
Trade Unions and that the Supreme Court rejected the appeal lodged in connection
with the alleged raid on the headquarters of the Independent Building Workers'
Trade Union No. 2 of Maipú.

	191.	The Committee observes, on the other hand, that the Government has
not expressly denied that the visit paid by
carabineros
to the headquarters
of the National Graphic Confederation was effected without producing a
judicial warrant, and that it has confirmed that an application was made
to the court in that connection.

	192.	In these circumstances, although it observes that neither the complainant
nor the Government has furnished sufficiently detailed information, the
Committee reiterates the principle that the right of the inviolability
of union premises also necessarily implies that the public authorities
cannot enter such premises without prior authorisation or without having
obtained a legal warrant to do so [see for example 230th Report, Case No.
1200 (Chile), para. 610, and 238th Report, Case No. 1169 (Nicaragua), para.
227].

6.
	Allegations concerning acts of anti-trade
	union discrimination

	(a)
	The complainant's allegations

	193.	The complainant organisation makes the following allegations:

-
In July 1983 the firm of Vercovich Ltda. took reprisals against the
workers who had participated in a legal strike, and the workers were unable
to induce the competent authority to correct the situation.   Twenty-five
per cent of the workers involved in the collective bargaining were dismissed
and the wages of the remainder were arbitrarily reduced.

-
In August 1983 eight leaders of the Industria Hucke at Valparaiso were
dismissed from that undertaking in virtue of section 13, clause (f), of
Legislative Decree No. 2200 under which staff may be dismissed if the undertaking's
needs so dictate.   The leaders affected were:  Luis Palma Romero, José
Márquez, Carlos Carreño Castro, Oscar Bonilla, Manuel Cárdenas, Pedro Cortés
Fredes, José Villalón Tapia and Santiago Rubio Sepúlveda.
-
In September 1983 the City Hotel threatened to dismiss workers who did
not give up the trade union and actually dismissed two workers without
the competent authority intervening to correct that situation.

-
The Hotel Carrera dismissed Juana Santos, chief telephone operator,
for her prominent participation in a legal strike.

-
Abraham Santángel was dismissed 48 hours after being elected President
of Industria Hucke Trade Union No. 1.

-
In November 1983 the Empresa Nacional del Carbón (ENACAR) dismissed
the trade union leaders of Schwager Trade Union No. 5:  Luis Badilla, Víctor
Jaramillo and Juan Flores.   Furthermore the Union was dissolved by court
order.

-
In December 1983 the Hotel Galerías dismissed 12 persons on the pretext
of staff cuts, while at the same time offering pay improvements to all
who gave up the Union.

-
In January 1984 the firm of Parro, Alvariño y Cía. dismissed two trade
union leaders for presenting draft collective agreements.

-
The firm of Goodyear dismissed Juan Carlos Martínez, the leader of Trade
Union No. 2, in January 1984.

	(b)
	The Government's reply

	194.	With reference to the allegations concerning the firm of Vercovich
Ltda., the Government states that it cannot answer these because the necessary
information (date, names, etc.) has not been supplied.   The Government
also reports that there is no record to show that the persons presumed
to have been affected have made use of the statutory remedies.

	195.	With reference to the dismissal of eight trade union leaders from
the Industria Hucke at Valparaiso, the Government states that on 10 August
1983 the contracts of the trade union leaders of Trade Union No. 1 of the
firm of Hucke at Valparaiso (Mr. Carlos Carreño Castro, Mr. Oscar Bonilla,
Mr. Luis Palma Romero, Mr. José Marquez and Mr. Manuel Cárdenas) were terminated
by agreement;  these persons signed discharges before the Labour Inspectorate
stating that the employer owed them nothing and that they had no complaint
to make.   The leaders of Trade Union No. 2 (Mr. Pedro Cortés Fredes, Mr.
Santiago Rubio Sepúlveda and Mr. José Villalón Tapia) were dismissed and
proceeded to lay before the courts judicial complaints against the undertaking.
The Labour Inspectorate at Valparaiso applied to the firm an administrative
fine of 20 Development Units in cash on 12 August 1983.

	196.	With reference to the allegations concerning the City Hotel, the
Government states that this firm has reported that the trade union is fully
operative and its leadership is functioning.

	197.	With reference to the dismissal of the trade unionist Juana Santos
the Government explains that, during the legal strike called by the workers'
trade union at the Hotel Carrera, the firm temporarily engaged a few persons
to do the essential jobs needed to keep the hotel in operation.   The person
mentioned, who holds no trade union office and who was working as a telephonist,
sabotaged the use of the telephone equipment by obstructing the work of
her temporary replacement, and for this the firm dismissed her.   The person
concerned complained of the firm to the courts, which sentenced the employer
to pay compensation.

	198.	With reference to the allegations concerning the firm of ENACAR,
the Government states that Trade Union No. 5 was declared dissolved for
lack of members by a judicial decision dated 2 November 1983.   The firm
of ENACAR offered each of the union's leaders, Mr. Luis Badilla, Mr. Víctor
Jaramillo and Mr. Juan Flores, a post because when they were leaders of
the trade union they did no work.   However, they did not accept the work
which the firm offered them and their contracts were withdrawn from them
on 25 November 1983.

	199.	With reference to the dismissal of workers of the Hotel Galerías,
the Government states that these dismissals were due to economic mismanagement
of the undertaking.   It is not true that workers were dismissed to induce
them to give up the trade union.   The fact of the matter was that four
persons were dismissed at that time for reasons of expense, and that this
did not affect the existence of the trade union at all.

	200.	With reference to the allegations concerning the firm of Parro, the
Government states that the two persons dismissed as reported in the complaint
were dismissed before the collective bargaining session, so that when the
draft collective agreement was presented those persons were not workers
of the undertaking.   They signed a discharge before the Labour Inspectorate
and were paid everything due to them.   The collective bargaining was concluded
successfully with the signing of a collective agreement for two years ending
in January 1986.

	201.	With reference to the firm of Goodyear, the Government states that
Mr. Juan Carlos Martínez was President of Operatives' Trade Union No. 1
and that when he was dismissed he was not a trade union leader.   In 1982
proceedings were taken to remove him from office on the grounds that he
had misappropriated money intended for the maintenance of the ambulance
and for staff recreational activities.   The court removed him from office
and the Court of Appeals confirmed the removal.

	(c)
	The Committee's conclusions

	202.	The Committee takes note that the Government states that it cannot
answer the allegations concerning dismissals from the firm of Vercovich
because the complainant organisation has not supplied sufficient information.
The Committee takes note further that,
according to the Government, the
three leaders of the firm of ENACAR to whom the complainant refers did
not accept an offer of work in the undertaking and that five trade union
leaders of the Hucke Company at Valparaiso terminated their contracts by
agreement with the undertaking.   The Committee also notes that, according
to the Government, the dismissals that took place in the Hotel Galerías
were only four in number, did not affect the existence of the trade union
at all and were due to economic mismanagement of the undertaking.   Lastly
the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the persons dismissed
from the firm of Parro were dismissed before the draft collective agreement
was presented and that Juan Carlos Martínez (of the firm of Goodyear) was
not a trade union leader when he was dismissed because the judicial authority
had removed him from office for misappropriation of funds.

	203.	The Committee observes, on the other hand, that the legitimacy of
other cases of dismissal alleged by the complainant has not been substantiated
by the Government:  namely, the dismissal of Abraham Santángel (which is
said to have taken place 48 hours after his election as President of Industria
Hucke Trade Union No. 1) and the two alleged dismissals from the City Hotel.
The Government acknowledges, on the other hand, that the Labour Inspectorate
of Valparaiso applied an administrative fine to the Hucke Company because
of the dismissal of three leaders of Trade Union No. 2 and that in the
case of the dismissal of the trade unionist Juana Santos the courts sentenced
the Hotel Carrera to pay compensation.

	204.	In these circumstances, the Committee draws the Government's attention
to the principle that no worker should be subjected to discrimination in
employment on the grounds of his trade union membership or activity, whether
past or present [see, for example, 235th Report, Cases Nos. 997, 999 and
1029 (Turkey), para. 38].   In this connection the Committee has indicated
on previous occasions that one way of protecting trade union leaders is
to provide that they cannot be dismissed either during the performance
of their duties or for a certain period of time after the expiry of their
mandate except, of course, where a serious offence has been committed [see,
for example, 217th Report, Case No. 1063 (Costa Rica), para. 151].

7.
	Other allegations

	(a)
	The complainant's allegations

	205.	The complainant organisation makes the following allegations:

-
In August 1983 Rodolfo Seguel was prevented from leaving the country
to attend the Congress of the International Confederation of Free Trade
Unions (ICFTU).   The ban was imposed by Judge Hernán Cereceda.

-
In October 1983 the Military Junta approved an Act under which the liability
for any act of violence perpetrated on the occasion
of public protests
or demonstrations automatically vests in those who call for such acts.
The Act provides penalties of imprisonment, restricted residence or exile.
It is perfectly obvious that this Act is directed specifically against
the National Command of Workers and any other dissident organisation which
calls for the expression of opposition to the regime.
-
In January 1984 the Chuquicamata Mining Division prevented Rodolfo Seguel,
the President of the Confederation of Copper Workers, from entering that
mine.

-
The workers of the Minimum Employment Programme (PEM) and the Employment
Programme for Heads of Households (POJH) do not enjoy the right to organise
themselves in trade unions and to present petitions.

	(b)
	The Government's reply

	206.	The Government states that the Code of Penal Procedure allows a judge
who is trying a person for the presumed commission of an offence to fix
bail for him on condition that he does not leave the country and thus flout
the course of justice.   The courts and judges are entirely independent
in administering justice in Chile.   Consequently the fact that Mr. Hernán
Cereceda Bravo, Judge of the Court of Appeals at Santiago, has forbidden
Mr. Rodolfo Seguel to leave the country is a matter within his sole jurisdiction.

	207.	The Government also states that the allegation that Mr. Rodolfo Seguel,
the trade union leader, was prevented from entering the Chuquicamata Mining
Division could not be verified owing to the vagueness of the information
supplied.   There is no indication of the exact date, the place of occurrence,
the authority which denied him entry, etc., particulars which are needed
for a conclusive reply.

	208.	Furthermore the Government states that the Act objected to by the
complainant is Act No. 18256, published in the
Diario Oficial
of 27 October
1983, which made some changes in Act No. 12927 of 1958 on State Security.
The purpose of the Act in question is to punish those who promote or
incite to demonstrations designed to disturb public order, incite demonstrations
designed to overthrow the constituted Government, incite demonstrations
designed to paralyse the country or promote a breach of order and public
peace.   The Act does not punish protest or public expression of opinion
in opposition to the economic, social security or housing policy of the
Government.   The offence defined by this Act consists not in "protesting"
but in promoting or inciting acts which violate the public peace.   The
text reads verbatim as follows:  "(i) Any person who, without permission,
promotes or calls for collective public acts in streets, squares and other
places in public use and who promotes or incites demonstrations of any
other kind that allow or facilitate a breach of the public peace."   These
offences are to be punishable by penalties of rigorous imprisonment, restricted
residence or exile for the medium term in any of its degrees, i.e. deprivation
of liberty for not less than 61 days
and not more than five years.   Without
prejudice to the foregoing, the perpetrators of these offences will be
jointly and severally liable for any damage caused by reason or on the
occasion of the aforementioned acts, irrespective of such liability also
laying with the material perpetrators of those acts.

	209.	The Government adds that there is not the slightest doubt that there
is a relationship of cause and effect between a "protest call" of the kind
defined by the Act and the consequences that may arise from it.   Since
May 1983, when the first "protests" began, they have steadily grown more
violent and have accounted for a great many dead and injured.   Those who
"call for protests" cannot be ignorant of the consequences those calls
will have.   The judge who investigates the facts will weigh the evidence
and the judgement in these proceedings conscientiously as provided by section
27 of the State Security Act.

	210.	Lastly the Government states that PEM and POJH are a form of unemployment
benefit, and that their beneficiaries consequently cannot organise themselves
in trade unions.   The right to organise in Chile, as under all the systems
of legislation in the world, vests only in workers who have an employment
relationship with their employer.

	(c)
	The Committee's conclusions

	211.	The Committee takes note that, according to the Government, the prohibition
on leaving the country which was imposed on Mr. Rodolfo Seguel, the trade
union leader, was ordered by a judge of the Court of Appeals in virtue
of the Code of Penal Procedure which allows a person
sub judice
for the
presumed commission of an offence to be prevented from leaving the country.
The Committee also notes that the Government states that, for lack of
information and details from the complainant, it has been unable to verify
the allegation that Mr. Rodolfo Seguel, the trade union leader, was prevented
from entering the Chuquicamata Mining Division.

	212.	With reference to Act No. 18256, published in the
Diario Oficial
of 27 October 1983, which punishes "any person who, without permission,
promotes or calls for collective public acts in streets, squares and other
places in public use and who promotes or incites demonstrations of any
other kind that allow or facilitate a breach of the public peace", the
Committee wishes to point out in this connection that the requirement of
administrative permission to hold public meetings and demonstrations is
not objectionable
per se
from the standpoint of the principles of freedom
of association.   The maintenance of public order is not incompatible with
the right to hold demonstrations so long as the authorities responsible
for public order reach agreement with the organisers of a demonstration
concerning the place where it will be held and the manner in which it will
take place.

	213.	Lastly, with reference to the denial to the workers of the Minimum
Employment Programme (PEM) and the Employment Programme for Heads of Households
(POJH) of the right to organise themselves in
trade unions and to present
petitions, the Committee takes note that, according to the Government,
PEM and POJH are a form of unemployment benefit, with the result that their
beneficiaries cannot organise because in Chile the right to organise vests
only in workers who have an employment relationship with their employer.
In this connection, the Committee points out to the Government that,
in virtue of the principles of freedom of association, all workers - with
the sole exception of members of the armed forces and police - should have
the right to establish and to join organisations of their own choosing.
The criterion for determining the persons covered by that right, therefore,
is not based on the existence of an employment relationship with an employer,
which is often non-existent, for example in the case of agricultural workers,
self-employed workers in general or those who practise liberal professions
and who should nevertheless enjoy the right to organise.   Consequently
the Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to recognising
the right of the workers of PEM and POJH to organise.

*
*   *

	214.	Lastly the complainant organisation presents a series of allegations
which have already been examined by the Committee in connection with other
cases, or which do not relate to specific breaches of freedom of association.

The Committee's recommendations

	215.	In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:

In view of the gravity of the allegations in this case the Committee deeply
regrets that the Government has not supplied sufficiently detailed replies
to all the allegations.   It therefore reminds the Government of the importance
which it attaches to the following principles:

(a)
Measures depriving trade union leaders and trade unionists of their
freedom on grounds related to their trade union activity, even where they
are merely summoned or questioned for a short period, constitute an obstacle
to the exercise of trade union rights.

(b)
Trade Union rights include the right to organise public demonstrations.
The maintenance of public order is not incompatible with the right to
hold demonstrations so long as the authorities responsible for public order
reach agreement with the organisers of a demonstration concerning the place
where it will be held and the manner in which it will take place.
(c)
According to the latest General Survey of the Committee of Experts,
national legislation which provides that all trade union leaders shall
belong to the occupation in respect of which the organisation carries on
its activities may impair the principles of freedom of association.   In
such a case, the dismissal of a worker who is a trade union leader causes
him to lose his status as a trade union officer, and impedes the freedom
of activity of the organisation and its right to elect its representatives
in freedom.   By placing a trade union leader in this situation the employer
interferes in trade union activity.

(d)
Similarly, a law which generally prohibits access to trade union office
because of any conviction is incompatible with the principles of freedom
of association, when the activity condemned is not prejudicial to exercising
trade union office with integrity.

(e)
The inviolability of union premises implies that the public authorities
should not enter such premises without prior authorisation or without having
obtained a legal warrant to do so.

(f)
No worker should be subjected to discrimination in employment on the
grounds of his trade union membership or activity, whether past or present.
The Committee has indicated on previous occasions that the protection
of trade union leaders can only be properly ensured if they cannot be dismissed
either during the performance of their functions or for a certain period
of time after the expiry of their mandate, except in cases where a serious
fault has been committed.

(g)
The Committee requests the Government to take measures with a view to
recognising the right of the workers of the Minimum Employment Programme
(PEM) and the Employment Programme for Heads of Households (POJH) to organise.

Case No. 1287

COMPLAINT PRESENTED BY THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF
ELECTRICAL AND POSTAL COMMUNICATIONS EMPLOYEES
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF COSTA RICA

	216.	The complaint is made in a communication from the National Federation
of Electrical and Postal Communications Employees dated 16 May 1984.
The Government replied by a communication dated 24 June 1985.

	217.	Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection
of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) and the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
Allegations of the complainant

	218.	The complainant alleges in its communication of 16 May 1984 that,
in violation of the collective agreement, Mr. Guido Núñez Román, General
Secretary of the Industrial Union of Electrical and Telecommunications
Workers, was dismissed in May 1981 for having denounced cases of discrimination
in the National Power and Light Company and corruption in certain quarters
in the use of that company's property.   The complainant states that the
First Labour Court ruled in Mr. Núñez Román's favour, observing that the
collective agreement had been violated by failure to follow the prescribed
procedure.   The Company appealed to the superior Labour Court which, in
1984, delivered judgement on the same lines as the Court of First Instance.
In April 1984 the Company filed an application for cassation.

	219.	The complainant further alleges that the collective agreement in
force is repeatedly violated in the National Power and Light Company, specifically
in the following instances:

(a)
wage adjustment of 20 per cent for certain workers (section 11);

(b)
seniority adjustment of 7.5 per cent in accordance with the collective
agreement (section 69);

(c)
appointment of staff at foreman level without holding a competition
(section 88);

(d)
refusal to give the Savings and Loan Fund to the workers, leaving it
in the Company's name (section 89);

(e)
refusal to grant other rights established for all workers in the collective
agreement (sections 61, 54, 25, 26 and others).

	220.	Lastly the complainant makes a series of allegations which go back
many years or which do not refer to violations of freedom of association.

B.
The Government's reply

	221.	The Government states in its communication of 24 June 1985 that,
in the case of the dismissal of Guido Núñez Román, the procedure of dismissal
without employer's liability was applied to him for having insulted, libelled
and defamed the management and high officials of the undertaking in various
documents which were signed or authorised by Guido Núñez and which were
circulated not only within the Company but also among the public.   Although
the case was, relatively speaking, won by Guido Núñez at first instance,
the Court stated:  "There is no claim to lost wages under section 82 of
the
Labour Code because, although the offence with which the plaintiff
was charged was not sufficiently serious to warrant dismissal, the fact
is that, in the opinion of the undersigned, there was always a disrespect
for the employer's representatives ...".   Later in the same judgement,
the Court explained that the plaintiff had uttered his expressions with
"
animus defendendi
" and not with "
animus injuriandi
", and on that ground
it declared the dismissal null and void.   Both parties appealed against
the judgement delivered at first instance inasmuch as the plaintiff, among
other petitions, asked for reinstatement, which had been refused at first
instance;  then the Superior Labour Court declared:  "And there is no doubt
that, in view of the foregoing, the conclusion reached is that the grounds
for dismissal were not met because the "intention to insult" was lacking,
since the expression was framed in general terms, without specifying persons
...".   For these reasons the Court considered that, although the offence
had been committed, dismissal was not the right penalty in view of the
circumstances surrounding the case.

	222.	The Government adds that, on 16 April 1984, Guido Núñez and the Company
appealed against the judgement of the Superior Labour Court.   The Second
Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice concluded on 3 October 1984 that
"in view of the phrases which occur repeatedly in the dossier - and which
therefore need not be repeated - if we take into account this background,
the plaintiff's position in defence of the workers and what he said in
this letter in, perhaps, rather rough phrases, the truth is that he did
not address them to a particular person or persons but in general terms
to those running the Company.   In these circumstances, there were insufficient
grounds for punishing the plaintiff with dismissal rather than a disciplinary
penalty of another magnitude, because the truth is that he did not use
those phrases in his personal capacity ... .   Therefore he must be excused
payment of the costs because, although he committed the offence, it was
not of such gravity as to warrant his removal from his post, in this case
owing to the circumstances surrounding the events".   Guido Núñez was again
refused reinstatement by this Court, so that the only thing he was granted
by the aforementioned courts at the conclusion of the proceedings was the
award of costs.

	223.	Lastly, with regard to the alleged violations of certain provisions
of the collective agreement in force in the National Power and Light Company,
the Government states that the instances referred to by the complainant
are being discussed and clarified before the courts.

C.
Conclusions of the Committee

	224.	With regard to the alleged dismissal of Mr. Guido Núñez Román, the
trade union leader, in May 1981 for having denounced cases of discrimination
and corruption in the National Power and Light Company, the Committee notes
that that Company applied to him the
procedure of dismissal without employer's
liability for having insulted, libelled and defamed the management and
high officials of the undertaking.

	225.	The Committee observes that, on 3 October 1984, the Second Chamber
of the Supreme Court of Justice concluded at last instance that Mr. Guido
Núñez Román's conduct constituted "insufficient grounds for punishing the
plaintiff with dismissal rather than a disciplinary penalty of another
magnitude, because the truth is that he did not use those phrases in his
personal capacity ...";  later, furthermore, the Supreme Court states that
the offence was not of such gravity as to warrant his removal from his
post.   The Committee further observes that, although the aforementioned
judicial decision recognised Mr. Núñez Román's right to payment of his
costs, it denied him reinstatement in his employment.

	226.	In these circumstances, the Committee can only conclude that the
dismissal of Mr. Guido Núñez Román, the trade union leader, was motivated
by his trade union activities, and constituted anti-trade union discrimination
contrary to Convention No. 98.   The Committee consequently requests the
Government to take steps with a view to the reinstatement of this trade
union leader in his employment.

	227.	More generally the Committee wishes to point out that section 82
of the Labour Code of Costa Rica provides in its second subsection that:
"If a dispute arises subsequent to the dismissal and due proof of the
reason is not forthcoming, the employee shall be entitled to payment of
the wages due in lieu of notice and to any leaving grant which may be due
to him and, by way of damages, to the wages which he would have earned
from the date of the termination of the contract to the date on which a
final judgment is given against the employer".   In this connection, the
Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that it does
not appear that sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination
- as set out in Convention No. 98 - is accorded by legislation which, in
practice, enables employers, on condition that they pay the compensation
prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal, to get rid of any
worker when the true reason for the dismissal is his trade union membership
or activity.   This in fact means that an employer, by paying compensation,
can dismiss any member of his staff, for trade union or other activities,
the public authorities being powerless to prevent him from doing so.
Protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials
who, in order to be able to carry out their duties in full independence,
must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of
the mandate which they hold from their trade unions.   This guarantee is
also necessary to secure respect for the principle that workers' organisations
have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom [see, for
example, 211th Report, Case No. 1053 (Dominican Republic), para. 163].
Furthermore the Committee observes that the Committee of Experts on the
Application of Conventions and Recommendations has been emphasising to
the Government for some years the importance of adopting specific provisions
to establish remedies
and sanctions for acts of anti-union discrimination.
The Committee requests the Government to take steps in that direction.

	228.	Lastly, with regard to the allegation concerning violations of certain
provisions of the collective agreement in force in the Power and Light
Company, the Committee wishes to recall that the relevant principle is
that disputes arising over the interpretation or application of the provisions
of collective agreements should be settled by bodies independent of the
parties [see, for example, 236th Report, Case No. 1206 (Peru), para. 509].
In this connection the Committee observes that the alleged violations
are being clarified before the courts.

Recommendations of the Committee

	229.	In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:

(a)
The Committee considers that the dismissal of Mr. Guido Núñez Román,
the trade union leader, having been motivated by his trade union activities,
constituted an act of anti-trade union discrimination contrary to Convention
No. 98.   The Committee consequently requests the Government to take steps
with a view to the reinstatement of this trade union leader in his employment.

(b)
The Committee points out to the Government that it does not appear that
sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is accorded
by legislation which, in practice, enables employers, on condition that
they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal,
to get rid of any worker when the true reason for dismissal is his trade
union membership or activity.

(c)
The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to punishing
acts of anti-union discrimination and to making appeal procedures available
to the victims of such acts.

Case No. 1310

COMPLAINT SUBMITTED BY THE WORLD CONFEDERATION OF
ORGANISATIONS OF THE TEACHING PROFESSION AGAINST
THE GOVERNMENT OF COSTA RICA

	230.	The World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession
submitted a complaint of infringement of trade union rights
in Costa Rica
in communications dated 16 and 17 October 1984.   The Government replied
on the matter in a letter dated 9 September 1985.

	231.	Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection
of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
Allegations made by the complainant

	232.	The World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession
alleges that the premises of a member organisation, the National Association
of Teachers, were searched and that the members of the Association were
prosecuted in breach of an agreement signed by the Government and the unions
of teachers represented by the Teachers' Front.

	233.	The Confederation explains that on 27 July 1984 an agreement was
signed between the above-mentioned parties putting an end to the strike
organised by the Teachers' Front.   This agreement made provision for negotiations
on a list of claims in support of which the teachers had gone on strike.
The list related to salaries, the cost of school transport, the prices
of certain goods and services (electricity, telephones, fuel, drinking
water, transport) and the adjustment of increases in the salaries of public
servants.    Section 8 of the agreement provided that the Government undertook
to take no measure of reprisal against workers of the Ministry of National
Education, or against teacher-leaders or students because of the activities
of the Teachers' Front.   Lastly, in accordance with the agreement, the
Government committed itself to negotiating with the Teachers' Front or
alternatively to taking the measures provided for in the said agreement.

	234.	However, according to the complainant Confederation, the premises
of the National Association of Teachers in the town of Cartago were searched,
documents were removed by the judicial authorities, and subsequently 800
teachers were taken to court for having - according to the National Association
of Teachers - claimed improvements in social conditions and increases in
salaries which the Government had been owing them for over two years.

B.
The Government's reply

	235.	In respect of the searching of trade union premises and the court
action taken against a number of unionised teachers, the Government replies
that the executive authorities were not involved in these activities.
They were carried out by the Office of the State
Prosecutor, coming under
the judicial authorities and therefore totally independent of the executive
authorities.

	236.	The Government explains that in Costa Rica strikes in the public
sector and in public education, which is considered to be a high priority
public service, are illegal since they infringe article 78 of the Constitution
which provides for the right to education, which is compulsory.   Furthermore,
the Government states, book II, title XV of the Penal Code (section 333)
provides that an official or public servant who abandons his post without
having legally terminated his functions, to the detriment of his service,
shall be liable to a fine of 20 to 70 days' pay.   Likewise, section 334,
dealing with incitement to a collective abandonment of work in the public
service, provides that any person inciting public servants or employees
in the public service to abandon their work shall be liable to imprisonment
of six months to two years and to a fine of 70 to 120 days' pay.   Lastly,
article 61 of the Constitution recognises the right to strike except in
the case of workers in the public service.

	237.	The Government maintains that the provisions in question are designed
to ensure the normal running of public services for the population since,
in its view, a strike in these services would undermine the very existence
of the State.

	238.	With its reply the Government encloses the text of a letter sent
to the Ministry of Labour by the Head of the State Prosecutor's Office,
stating that the Office in question comes under the judicial authorities
and acts in complete independence as regards penal action.   Consequently,
the executive authorities played no part whatsoever in the proceedings
taken against the teachers who took part in a strike that had been declared
illegal.   The letter admits that a number of trade union premises were
searched, with a legal warrant, at the request of a representative of the
State Prosecutor's Office since the law was looking for written proof of
the connection between the trade union and the offence covered by article
333 of the Penal Code.   The searches were carried out in accordance with
the provisions of the Code of Penal Procedure and the trade union representatives
in question have so far not proved that any administrative irregularities
or abuse of power by the authorities occurred.   The letter also refers
to the statements made by the Government concerning the illegal nature
of the strike in the public services, and points out that article 333 of
the Penal Code, in respect of the collective abandonment of work by public
servants or employees, causing prejudice to their service, is similar to
article 330 of the Italian Penal Code.

	239.	The Government adds that the examining magistrate of Puntarenas,
who dealt with the initial stages of the case in November 1984, ruled that
the case should be withdrawn and subsequently, and as an exceptional measure,
adjourned the proceedings for one year.   Furthermore, the examining magistrate
of Cartago, who was also seized of the affair, likewise ruled that the
case be dismissed but the State Prosecutor's Office appealed against this
ruling and won its appeal
before the Higher Penal Court (second chamber).
However, the Government goes on, the judge of Cartago, who once again
judged the substance of the case, acquitted the teachers on the grounds
that the stoppage of their classes caused no prejudice to the teaching
system and that, although the strike had been declared illegal by the Higher
Civil Court, a large nummber of pupils had stayed away from school.   The
Government includes copies of the above-mentioned court rulings in its
reply.

	240.	Regarding the conversations with the Teachers' Front, the Government
agrees that these did not take place but explains that this was because
of divergencies within the organisation itself.   It adds that it reached
agreements in February and July 1985 with the National Association of Teachers
and includes in its reply a copy of the said agreements relating to increases
in the salaries of public servants and the setting up of a joint committee
to determine the increase in the number of articles to be added to the
"housewife's basket".

	241.	Furthermore, the Government furnishes the text of a Decree dated
20 June 1985 to revise the said "housewife's basket", to which 14 articles
have been added as compared with 1984 in compliance with the agreement
of 19 February 1985 between the Government and representatives of the National
Association of Teachers.   The Government also forwards the text of another
agreement whereby the manual describing classes and teaching jobs, drawn
up by the General Directorate of the Civil Service in agreement with the
union, is to be submitted to the Chairman and General Secretary of the
National Association of Teachers;  the manual is to be included in the
draft budget for 1986 as soon as its financial implications have been studied.

	242.	In conclusion, the Government considers that, contrary to what the
complainants alleged, it has acted responsibly in this case vis-à-vis the
teachers of Costa Rica.

C.
The Committee's conclusions

	243.	The present case relates to reprisals said to have been taken against
unionised teachers following a strike they had called to secure acceptance
of claims of an essentially economic and occupational nature.   The trade
unionists in question were prosecuted under Costa Rican law for having
taken part in a strike and the premises of their trade union were searched
to discover the link between the trade union and the strike.   The Government
does not deny the facts, but explains that in accordance with Costa Rican
law, teachers are public sector employees who do not enjoy the right to
strike.   Consequently the strike was declared illegal by the judicial
authorities and, on the orders of the said judicial authorities, the trade
union premises were searched and the teachers prosecuted.   However, they
were acquitted by the courts.   The Government further
maintains that agreements
were reached with the persons concerned to bring this labour dispute to
an end.

	244.	The Committee notes with interest that, according to the Government,
the trade unionists who had been prosecuted were acquitted and that agreements
were reached with the National Association of Teachers to bring the dispute
to an end.

	245.	Nevertheless the Committee is obliged to draw the Government's attention
to the importance it has always attached to the right to strike as a legitimate
means of defending the economic and social interests of workers and their
organisations.   [See, in particular, Fourth Report, Case No. 5 (India),
para. 27.]

	246.	Although the Committee has recognised the principle that there may
be restrictions on the right to strike, or even that strikes may be prohibited
in the public service or in essential services (whether public, semi-public
or private), it has frequently stated that this principle would become
meaningless if the legislation defined the public service or essential
services too broadly.   Consequently the Committee, like the Committee
of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, considers
that any prohibition or restriction should be confined to public servants
acting in their capacity as agents of the public authority or to essential
services whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or
health of the whole or part of the population.   [See 230th Report, Case
No. 1173, (Canada/British Columbia), para. 577, and Case No. 1225 (Brazil),
para. 668.]   The Committee considers that the teachers do not come under
this category.   [See, for example, 221st Report, Case No. 1097 (Poland),
para. 84;  226th Report, Case No. 1164 (Honduras), para. 343;  and 230th
Report, Case No. 1173 (Canada/British Columbia), para. 577, already cited.]

	247.	The Committee therefore invites the Government to re-examine its
legislation and, in particular, the provisions of the Labour Code (article
369 (a)) and of the Penal Code (sections 333 and 334) so that the list
of activities in which strikes are prohibited is confined to the public
service and to essential services in the strict sense of the term.

The Committee's recommendations

	248.	In the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:

(a)
The Committee notes with interest that in the present case the unionised
teachers who had been prosecuted for having taken part in a strike were
acquitted and that agreements were reached with
the National Association
of Teachers putting an end to this dispute.
(c)
The Committee invites the Government to re-examine its legislation so
that the list of activities in which strikes are prohibited is confined
to public servants acting in their capacity as agents of the public authority
or to essential services whose interruption would endanger the life, personal
safety or health of the whole or part of the population.

Case No. 1291

COMPLAINT SUBMITTED BY THE TRADE UNION CONFEDERATION OF
COLOMBIAN WORKERS (CSTC) AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA

	249.	The Committee examined this case at its meeting in November 1984,
when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.   [See 236th
Report, paras. 686 to 697, approved by the Governing Body at its 228th
Session (November 1984).]

	250.	Since then the CSTC furnished further information in support of its
complaint in a communication dated 23 April 1985.   The Government sent
its observations on the outstanding allegations in communications of 29
May, 10 July and 13 August 1985.

	251.	Colombia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of
the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
Previous examination of the case

	252.	The outstanding allegation in this case concerns the dismissal of
13 unionised workers from the enterprise "Industrías Alimenticias Noël
SA".   According to the complainant, this measure, which occurred when
a list of grievances had been submitted to the employer, was designed to
weaken the works union.   The measure is also said to be contrary to section
25 of Legislative Decree No. 2351 which states that employers may not dismiss
workers when a list of grievances has been submitted.

	253.	At its meeting in November 1984, the Committee, noting that the Government
had not furnished a detailed reply to this allegation, requested the Government
to send its observations on the matter.

B.
Subsequent developments

	254.	In response to a request from the Committee, the complainant organisation
supplied the names of 15 dismissed workers on 23 April 1985.

	255.	In its communication of 29 May 1985, the Government states that the
Labour Code permits the unilateral termination of the contract of employment,
without the grounds being stated but with compensation being paid for the
prejudice suffered.   The parties are free to follow this procedure at
any time without the administrative labour authority having the possibility
of demanding explanations as to the grounds for the termination.   Dismissed
workers are entitled to appeal to the labour courts for the restitution
of their rights, which is what happened in the present case.

	256.	In its communications of 10 July and 13 August 1985, the Government
provides information on progress in the court proceedings.   Thirteen workers
lodged appeals with the social chambers of the Medellín courts.   Rulings
were handed down in three cases, in two of which the employer was acquitted.

	257.	The Government specifies that the contracts of employment were broken
unilaterally by the employer on the basis of section 64 of the Labour Code,
and of section 8 of Legislative Decree No. 2351 of 1965.   This provision
enables the parties to terminate the contract without stating the grounds
for so doing.   However it goes on to provide that the employer must pay
the worker compensation corresponding to the pay he would have received
during the rest of his contract or, if the contract was of unlimited duration,
45 days' pay plus supplementary benefits varying according to the worker's
length of service.   It is further provided that where a worker who has
completed ten years' continuous service has been dismissed without justification,
the labour court may, at the worker's request, order his reinstatement
under the same conditions of employment and with payment of his salary
or of compensation for loss of earnings.   The Government maintains that
Colombian labour law embodies the principle of autonomy of the parties
in unilaterally terminating a contract of employment, requiring however
that the party responsible for breaking the contract should make reparation.
The Government states that if an employer breaks a contract of employment
because he considers that a worker has not fulfilled his contract - and
proves this before a court - this should not be construed as infringing
trade union rights.

	258.	The Government also states that it is not the place of the administrative
labour authority to intervene in cases before the courts.   Nor is the
Ministry empowered by law to determine the grounds on which a contract
of employment was terminated, this being a function entrusted by the Labour
Code to the labour courts.   According to the Government, the rights of
employers and of workers are safeguarded perfectly by the law since the
latter gives both parties the possibility of unilaterally terminating a
contract of
employment where they consider that this has not been fulfilled
and enables them to take appropriate legal action if they believe their
rights have been infringed.   In the Government's opinion, the law may
not forbid employers or workers to terminate a contract of employment unilaterally
since this would mean infringing the personal freedoms embodied in the
national Constitution.   The dismissals which occurred at the "Industrías
Alimenticias Noël SA" enterprise are therefore normal lawful occurrences
which, in accordance with the law, may be brought before the ordinary labour
courts if they are considered to be illegal and/or unjust.

C.
The Committee's conclusions

	259.	The Committee has taken note of the explanations furnished by the
Government concerning the dismissals which took place in "Industrías Alimenticias
Noël SA".   In particular it notes that, in accordance with the Colombian
Labour Code, employers may unilaterally terminate a contract of employment,
even without justification, by paying the workers concerned the compensation
provided for by law.

	260.	In this connection the Committee must point out to the Government
that it does not appear that sufficient protection against acts of anti-union
discrimination - as set out in Convention No. 98 - is accorded by legislation
which, in practice, enables employers, on condition they pay the compensation
prescribed by law in all cases of unjustified dismissal, to get rid of
any worker, when the true reason for dismissal is his trade union membership
or activity.   [See, for example, 211th Report, Case No. 1053 (Dominican
Republic), para. 163.]

	261.	In the present case, the Committee must point out that the dismissals
of members of the Noël SA works union took place at a time when the union
had submitted a list of grievances to the employer on which the latter
refused to negotiate.   The Committee is of the view that in such a case
the authorities should recognise that a presumption of acts of anti-union
discrimination is involved, should rapidly undertake the necessary inquiries
and, where necessary, take measures to avoid the recurrence of acts of
this kind.   The Committee therefore requests the Government to consider
the adoption of texts providing effective protection against acts of anti-union
discrimination, both in law and in practice, in accordance with Article
1 of Convention No. 98, ratified by Colombia.   The Committee draws the
attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions
and Recommendations to this case.

The Committee's recommendations

	262.	In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Governing Body
to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:

(a)
The Committee points out to the Government that it does not appear that
sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is accorded
by legislation which, in practice, enables employers, on condition they
pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal,
to get rid of any worker when the true reason for dismissal is his trade
union membership or activity.

(b)
The Committee is of the view that, in cases such as that of the Noël
SA enterprise, the authorities should recognise that a presumption of anti-union
discrimination is involved, should rapidly undertake the necessary inquiries
and should, if necessary, adopt measures to avoid a recurrence of dismissals
of this kind.

(c)
The Committee requests the Government to consider the adoption of texts
providing effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination
both in law and in practice.   The Committee draws the attention of the
Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations
to this case.

Case No. 1293

COMPLAINTS PRESENTED BY THE UNIFIED WORKERS' CONFEDERATION
AND THE GENERAL CONFEDERATION OF WORKERS AGAINST THE
GOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

	263.	The complaints are contained in communications from the Unified Workers'
Confederation (CUT) and the General Confederation of Workers (CGT) dated
respectively 5 July and 4 October 1984.   The CUT presented additional
information in a communication dated 24 July 1984, and the CGT in communications
dated 13 and 17 November 1984.   The Government replied in communications
dated 2 November 1984 and 31 January and 23 May 1985.

	264.	The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and
Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the
Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
The complainants' allegations

	265.	The CUT alleges that the following persons were dismissed in connection
with trade union activities:  Marcelino Manuel Uribe (a trade unionist
in the heavy equipment undertaking of the Dominican Cement Works, dismissed
without reason on 1 June 1984), Elías Adames Boyer and Alfonso Sánchez
(both trade union leaders, dismissed on 16 June 1984 from the Río Haina
state sugar plantation as part of an operation carried out against the
CUT).

	266.	The CGT alleges in its first communication that the management of
the "Porvenir" state sugar plantation pressured trade union leaders to
leave the trade union or give up their jobs;  the management also stopped
the check off deduction of trade union dues in violation of the current
collective agreement in force.   In its later communication, the CGT states
that the trade union in question has reached a satisfactory agreement on
these matters with the management of the plantation.

	267.	The CGT adds that the National Office of Land Transportation (ONATRATE)
unfairly dismissed a number of its employees, starting on 8 October 1984.
This occurred during trade union elections, which ended on 19 October.
According to the CGT, four of the persons concerned featured on one of
the two lists of candidates for nomination to the executive committee of
the trade union.

B.
The Government's reply

	268.	Referring to the dismissal of Marcelino Manuel Uribe, the Government
forwarded a letter from the undertaking where he worked, stating that the
reason for the dismissal was undisciplined behaviour in the undertaking,
to the extent that "as regards the incidents occurring in April and the
would be strike of May 1984, this person was one of the instigators of
that strike ... the said person is not a member of any trade union organisation".
According to the Government, Mr. Uribe was dismissed under section 69
of the Labour Code.

	269.	The Government also states that the management of the "Porvenir"
sugar plantation and the CGT reached satisfactory agreements on the matters
referred to in the complaints.

	270.	The Government states in addition that Elías Adames Boyer and Alfonso
Sánchez were not dismissed due to trade union activities.   The former
was dismissed for failing to discharge satisfactorily the duties for which
he had been engaged.   The latter was reinstated when it was determined
that the reason for his dismissal was not sufficiently valid.

	271.	As regards the dismissals in the ONATRATE, the Government states
that some dismissals did in fact take place owing to the change in management,
as a result of the administrative reorganisation of the office, but in
no case did they relate to trade union activities, as is proved by the
fact that most of the persons dismissed did not belong to the trade union
operating in ONATRATE.

C.
The Committee's conclusions

	272.	The Committee notes that the parties to the collective dispute which
occurred in the "Porvenir" sugar plantation have reached an agreement which
is satisfactory to both parties.   The Committee also notes that trade
union leader Alfonso Sánchez has been reinstated in the Río Haina sugar
plantation.   Lastly, the Committee takes note of the Government's explanations
concerning the dismissals which took place in the ONATRATE.

	273.	On the other hand, the Committee observes that, according to the
Government, the trade union leader Elías Adames Boyer was dismissed for
failing to discharge satisfactorily the duties for which he had been engaged.
In this respect, the Committee regrets that the Government has not provided
more precise information on the specific reasons why the work of this trade
union leader was considered unsatisfactory.   In addition, the Committee
observes that, as regards the dismissal of Marcelino Manuel Uribe, the
Government has forwarded a letter from the undertaking where this person
worked, indicating that his dismissal was directly linked to "the incidents
occurring in April and the would-be strike of May 1984", of which he was
"one of the instigators".   The Committee also observes that Mr. Uribe
was dismissed under section 69 of the Labour Code, that is, without a reason
being given.   In these circumstances, the Committee regrets that Mr. Uribe
was dismissed for carrying out trade union activities, thereby infringing
Article 1 of Convention No. 98.   It draws the attention of the Government
to the principle that it does not appear that sufficient protection against
acts of anti-union discrimination - as set out in Convention No. 98 - is
accorded by legislation which, in practice, enables employers, on condition
that they pay the compensation prescribed by law in cases of unjustified
dismissal, to get rid of any worker when the true reason for dismissal
is his trade union membership or activities.   [See, for example, 211th
Report, Case No. 1053 (Dominican Republic), para. 163.]   The Committee
draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions
and Recommendations to this case.

The Committee's recommendations

	274.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions:

(a)
The Committee notes that Marcelino Manuel Uribe was dismissed for carrying
out trade union activities, thereby infringing Article 1 of Convention
No. 98.

(b)
The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principle
that it does not appear that sufficient protection against acts of anti-union
discrimination is accorded by legislation which, in practice, enables employers,
on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law in cases
of unjustified dismissal, to get rid of any worker when the true reason
for the dismissal is his trade union membership or activities.

(c)
The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the
Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this case.

Case No. 1306

COMPLAINT SUBMITTED BY THE INTERNATONAL CONFEDERATION OF
ARAB TRADE UNIONS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF MAURITANIA

	275.	The Committe has already examined this case at its meeting in February
1985 when it submitted an interim report which was approved by the Governing
Body.   [See 238th Report, paras. 298-311, February-March 1985.]   Since
then, the Government has sent the ILO 1985 a certain amount of information
on the case in two telegrams, dated 28 April and 13 May.   At its May 1985
meeting, the Committee adjourned its examination of the case and requested
the Government to supply additional details.

	276.	Mauritania has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection
of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
Previous examination of the case

	277.	The International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions (ICATU) submitted
allegations concerning the arrest of officials and trade union activists
of one of its affiliates, the Union of Mauritanian
Workers (UTM), including
that of the organisation's General Secretary El Kory Ould Hmeity, and the
death as a result of ill-treatment and torture of Sidi Mohamed Ben Aiat,
who held the post of director of the commercial department of the Fuel
Company.

	278.	The Government replied that the trade unionists cited in the complaint
were accused of undermining the security of the State by having acted in
collusion with a foreign diplomatic mission but failed to specify the precise
acts with which they were charged.   The Government did not reply to the
allegation concerning the death of Sidi Mohamed Ben Aiat as a result of
ill-treatment.

	279.	In these circumstances, the Committee requested the Government at
its February 1985 meeting to submit detailed information on the specific
facts which led to the arrest of the UTM officials and to state if legal
proceedings were being taken against them.   It also requested the Government
to reply to the allegations concerning the death of a union official as
a result of ill-treatment.

	280.	In a later communication dated 20 February 1985, the General Secretary
of the UTM, El Kory Ould Hmeity, thanked the ILO on behalf of the Mauritanian
trade unionists for its defence of members of trade unions subjected to
ill-treatment of every kind.

	281.	In telegrams sent on 28 April and 13 May 1985, the Government stated
that all the imprisoned trade unionists had been released under a political
amnesty granted on 2 December 1984 and that Sidi Mohamed Ben Aiat had died
from an illness.

	282.	At its May 1985 meeting, the Committee decided to postpone its examination
of the case as the Government's observations had reached it very late.
However, in view of the seriousness of the allegation concerning the
death under torture of a trade union official, it urged the Government
to supply additional details on the circumstances surrounding the death
of Sidi Mohamed Ben Aiat and to indicate whether an independent inquiry
into the matter had taken place.   In accordance with normal procedure,
the Office transmitted the Committee's request to the Government.

	283.	In a communication dated 13 June 1985 the Office informed the International
Confederation of Arab Trade Unions that consideration of the case had been
postponed and notified it that the Government claimed in a telegram sent
on 13 May 1985 that Sidi Mohamed Ben Aiat had died from an illness.   The
Office therefore asked the complainant for further details in this regard.
There has since been no reply from the complainant.

	284.	On 22 August 1985 the Office sent a telegram to the Government of
Mauritania requesting it again to comment on the case, but no reply has
yet been received.

B.
The Committee's conclusions

	285.	The Committee notes that the officials of the Union of Mauritanian
Workers arrested in March 1984 were released in December 1984 after being
held in custody for eight months without having been tried by an independent
and impartial court.

	286.	The Committee notes from the complainant's allegations that 17 trade
union activists and officials suffered from anti-union repression and that
one of them died under torture.

	287.	The complainant has not indicated the grounds for the arrest of the
trade unionists.   The Government, for its part, states that they were
imprisoned on a charge of undermining the security of the State but has
not specified the precise acts which they were said to have committed.

	288.	The complainant has not commented on the Government's claim that
Sidi Mohamed Ben Aiat died from an illness even though the Office has specifically
invited it to do so.

	289.	Regarding the large number of trade union activists and officials
held in custody without any charges being brought against them, the Committee
notes with interest that they have now been released.   It nevertheless
condemns the imprisonment of union officials for eight months in violation
of the fundamental right of trade unionists, like any other person, not
to be held in custody unless convicted by an independent and impartial
court.

	290.	Regarding the alleged death of a trade union official under torture,
the Committee can only note the Government's reply to the effect that the
person concerned died from an illness and the complainant's silence on
the matter even though it was invited to comment.   The Committee finds
itself confronted by two contradictory statements neither of which is supported
by evidence.   In view of the lack of detail regarding the complainant's
allegations and of the clear statement made by the Government, and since
the complainant organisation has not taken advantage of its right to submit
further information in support of its complaint, the Committee considers
that the complainant has not substantiated its allegations.   This aspect
of the case does not therefore require further examination.

The Committee's recommendations

	291.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions:
(a)
The Committee notes that the trade union officials and activists who
had been arrested have now been released.   It nevertheless condemns the
holding of union officials in custody for eight months without their having
been convicted by an independent and impartial court.

(b)
In view of the contradictory versions concerning the circumstances of
the death of a trade union official submitted by the complainant and by
the Government, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does
not, therefore, require further examination.

Case No. 1317

COMPLAINT PRESENTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION
OF EMPLOYERS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF NICARAGUA

	292.	The complaint is set forth in a communication from the International
Organisation of Employers (IOE) dated 19 December 1984.   The IOE transmitted
additional information in a communication dated 27 December 1984.   The
Government replied by a communication dated 27 May 1985.

	293.	Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection
of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) and the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
The complainant's allegations

	294.	The complainant states that the ILO convened in Mexico, from 3 to
7 December 1984, an important seminar to which representatives of employers'
organisations in Latin America were invited in order to discuss in particular
the role of employers' organisations in the creation of jobs.   Mr. Enrique
Bolaños Geyer, the Chairman of the Supreme Council of Private Enterprise
in Nicaragua (COSEP), announced that he would participate.

	295.	According to the complainant, Mr. Bolaños, taking his passport which,
as a precaution, he had photocopied and which two Managua notaries had
reported intact, presented himself at the passport checking window of Managua
airport on 17 November 1984, i.e. 16 days before the opening of the seminar.
He was forbidden to leave the country because a page was missing from
his passport;  a page had in fact been torn out of the document.

	296.	The complainant states that, at the request of the other participants
who had announced that they would participate in the seminar, the Director-General
of the ILO addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on 20 November
1984, a telegram asking the Minister to intervene in order to facilitate
the departure of Mr. Enrique Bolaños Geyer, the Chairman of the COSEP,
from Nicaragua so as to enable him to participate in the seminar in question.
According to the complainant, this message remained unanswered.   Hence
Mr. Bolaños Geyer was unable to obtain a new passport, in place of the
one which had been mutilated, in time to attend the ILO meeting in Mexico.

	297.	The complainant adds that on 3 December 1984 the International Organisation
of Employers and approximately 40 participants in the seminar addressed
a telegram to the Co-ordinator of the Sandinist Junta regretting with consternation
that, despite the message from the Director-General of the ILO, Mr. Bolaños
had been forbidden to leave the country in order to attend the seminar,
protesting at the violation of freedom of association and of fundamental
rights which this entails, and requesting as a matter of urgency that Mr.
Bolaños be permitted to participate in the seminar.   This telegram too
remained unanswered.

	298.	In support of its allegations the IOE transmits a letter it received
from Mr. Bolaños in which he stated that, on 17 November 1984, migration
officials removed pages 11 and 12 and pages 21 and 22 from his passport
and then proceeded to cancel the passport.   Attached to the letter is
a photocopy of all the pages of Mr. Bolaños's passport, taken the day before
he presented himself to the migration services and bearing, at the foot
of the page, a note to the effect that on 16 November 1984 all pages of
the passport were complete and properly bound.

	299.	Furthermore the complainant adds a statement signed by 23 persons
at variance with the Sandinist regime and calling themselves "captive dissidents",
in which they report that the Sandinist Government has denied them the
right to leave the country freely, and arbitrarily prevented them from
doing so although there is no legal impediment to warrant such a course.
According to the statement, the improper and illegal procedures used
to the detriment of the persons referred to include refusal to issue exist
visas on the pretext of non-production of documents not required by law,
loss of the passport, the existence of higher orders and inclusion in a
special list, and invalidation of the passport either by removing or tearing
a page from it or by making laterations in it.

	300.	The statement in question mentions, in addition to the case of Mr. Bolaños
and of certain employers' leaders and members of various political parties,
the cases of the following persons in particular:

NICOLAS BOLAÑOS GEYER:
President of UNCAFENIC, Director of Upanica and
delegate to the COSEP.   He was refused a visa on the grounds that there
was a backlog of work.

JUAN RAMON AVILES:
Executive Secretary of the COSEP.   He was refused a
visa at the migration offices on the grounds that his date of birth was
wrong.

FRANCISCO CALDERA:
Executive Secretary of Conapro.   He was denied the issue
of a passport at the migration offices on the grounds that it had been
sent to Special Zone No. 1 by unintentional error.

ORESTES ROMERO ROJAS:
Executive Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce of
Nicaragua.   His passport was delivered to him without an exit visa on
the grounds that one could not be granted to him.

FRANK LEY:
Director of the Chamber of Commerce.   His passport was not delivered
to him;  he was made to go repeatedly to the migration office and was not
given any reply.

CARLOS NOGUERA:
Delegate of the Nicaraguan Development Institute (INDE)
to the Nicaraguan Democratic Co-ordination Body.   His passport was held
at the migration office on the grounds that there were restrictions on
the issue of visas to certain persons.

	301.	Lastly the IOE reminds the ILO that in 1982 it filed a complaint
with the Committee on Freedom of Association alleging that the Government
was obstructing the participation of leaders of the COSEP in international
meetings (Case No. 1114) and that the Committee felt bound to recall that
"representatives of workers and employers should enjoy appropriate facilities
for carrying out their functions, including the right to leave the country
when their activities on behalf of the persons they represent so require".

B.
The Government's reply

	302.	The Government states in its communication of 27 May 1985 that, according
to information from the Migration and Aliens Directorate, section 16 of
the Migration Act, reading as follows, was in fact applied to Mr. Bolaños
Geyer:  "No passport or identity and travel document which exhibits alterations
or corrections and from which pages or covers are missing shall be valid
..."   In this connection the Government states that the only restrictions
in
existence in the country on travel abroad are those expressly laid down
in the provisions of law.   Furthermore the Government states that it has
not imposed gratuitous restrictions on any employer.   As evidence of the
foregoing it may be reported that, according to the migration registers,
the same Mr. Bolaños Geyer has made 14 trips abroad without any obstacle
between January 1983 and February 1985 (the Government transmits official
certification from the Migration and Aliens Directorate showing 18 departures
from the country by Mr. Bolaños between 1981 and 1985).

	303.	The Government adds that neither have any gratuitous restrictions
been imposed on the self-styled "captive dissidents" referred to in the
complaint from the complainant organisation.   As proof of its assertion,
the Government transmits official certification recording the various departures
from the country effected in recent years by Mr. Juan Ramón Avilés, Mr.
Orestes Romero Rojas and eight more "captive dissidents".

C.
The Committee's conclusions

	304.	The Committee observes that in the present case the complainant organisation
has alleged the existence of arbitrary restrictions on the right to leave
Nicaragua freely.   In particular the complainant has referred, firstly,
to the case of Mr. Bolaños Geyer, the Chairman of the COSEP, who was unable
to attend a seminar organised by the ILO owing to the removal of some pages
from his passport and secondly to the case of 23 persons calling themselves
"captive dissidents", among whom it refers especially to six leaders of
employers' organisations.

	305.	The Committee further observes that the complainant has not indicated
the dates on which these six leaders of employers' organisations were prevented
from leaving the country, nor whether such restrictions have obstructed
or prevented the pursuit of activities by those persons in their capacity
as leaders of employers' organisations.

	306.	The Committee takes note of the Government's statement that it has
imposed no gratuitous restrictions on any employer for travel abroad and
that the only restrictions in existence in Nicaragua in that connection
are those expressly laid down in the provisions of law.

	307.	More specifically, with reference to Mr. Bolaños Geyer, the Chairman
of the COSEP, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, section
16 of the Migration Act was applied to this employers' leader - who has
left the country 18 times between 1981 and 1985 - and that this section
provides that "No passport or identity and travel document which exhibits
alterations or corrections and from which pages or covers are missing shall
be valid ..."   In this connection, the Committee regrets that the Government
has confined
itself to mentioning section 16 of the Migration Act, omitting
to comment on the complainant organisation's assertion that migration officials
removed the sheet bearing pages 11 and 12 and that bearing pages 21 and
22 from the passport on 17 November 1984 and then cancelled it.   The Committee
also observes that the Government has not referred either to the complainant's
assertion that on 16 November 1984, the day before that on which Mr. Bolaños
proposed to leave the country, two notaries were able to report that his
passport was intact.

	308.	The Committee strongly deplores the fact that, after the incident
affecting Mr. Bolaños had occurred on 17 November 1984, the authorities
did not act on the request made by the Director-General of the ILO on 20
November 1984 that Mr. Bolaños's departure from the country should be facilitated
in order to enable him to participate in the seminar organised by the ILO
which was to be held in Mexico from 3 to 7 December, that is to say a sufficient
number of days after the date on which the incident in question occurred.

	309.	Having regard to the foregoing considerations, the Committee concludes
that the Government has not justified the illegal measures, involving the
removal of pages from Mr. Bolaños' passport, which prevented him once again
from leaving Nicaragua to attend the seminar organised by the ILO in Mexico.
In these circumstances, and having regard also to the fact that the Government
has not referred specifically to other leaders of employers' organisations
having been forbidden to leave the country or obstructed in doing so -
although the complainant has not emphasised that these cases were connected
with the pursuit of activities in their capacity as leaders of employers'
organisations - the Committee is bound to draw the Government's attention
as it has done in the past on several occasions, and particularly in 1983
regarding Mr. Bolaños, to the principle that representatives of workers
and employers should enjoy appropriate facilities for carrying out their
functions, including the right to leave the country when their activities
on behalf of the persons they represent so require [see 222nd Report, Case
No. 1114 (Nicaragua), para. 71], and that the free movement of these representatives
should be ensured by the authorities.

	310.	The Committee also requests the Government to take steps to ensure
that the appropriate authorities do not hinder the participation by leaders
of workers' or employers' organisations in activities designed to promote
and defend the interests of their members.

The Committee's recommendations

	311.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve the present report and in particular the following conclusions:
(a)
The Committee concludes that the Government has not justified the illegal
measures, involving the removal of pages from Mr. Bolaños' passport, which
once again prevented Mr. Bolaños, the Chairman of the COSEP, from leaving
Nicaragua to attend a seminar organised by the ILO in Mexico from 3 to
7 December 1984.

(b)
In addition, the Committee strongly deplores the fact that the Nicaraguan
authorities did not act on the request made by the Director-General of
the ILO on 20 November 1984 that Mr. Bolaños's departure from the country
should be facilitated in order to enable him to participate in the seminar
in question.

(c)
The Committee draws the Government's attention as it has done in the
past on several occasions, particularly in 1983 regarding Mr. Bolaños,
to the principle that representatives of workers and employers should enjoy
appropriate facilities for carrying out their functions, including the
right to leave the country when their activities on behalf of the persons
they represent so require, and that the free movement of these representatives
should be ensured by the authorities.

(d)
The Committee requests the Government to take steps to ensure that the
appropriate authorities do not hinder the participation by leaders of workers'
or employers' organisations in activities designed to promote and defend
the interests of their members.

Case No. 1318

COMPLAINT PRESENTED BY THE GERMAN WORKERS' CONFEDERATION
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY

	312.	On 21 December 1984, the German Workers' Confederation (Deutscher
Arbeitnehmerverband - DAV) lodged a complaint against the Government of
the Federal Republic of Germany.   On 6 February 1985, the complainant
submitted additional information in support of its complaint.   The Government
presented its observations on this complaint in communications dated 23 April
and 3 May 1985.

	313.	The Federal Republic of Germany has ratified the Freedom of Association
and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) and the
Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
Allegations of the complainant

	314.	In its communication of 21 December 1984, the DAV complains of the
withdrawal of its capacity to bargain collectively by decisions of several
German courts, which resulted in its being deprived of the right to enjoy
the special privileges recognised by legislation for trade unions in the
labour courts and in the management of enterprises.

	315.	The complainant, which has approximately 15,000 members, also states
that it appeals against the decision of the European Commission on Human
Rights of Strasbourg of 3 October 1983, which nonsuited its complaint of
alleged violations of Articles 11 (on freedom of association) and 14 (on
non-discrimination) of the European Convention on Human Rights.

	316.	Reviewing the background of the lawsuit which brought it into conflict
with the Federation of Workers in Mining and Energy (IG Bergbau-Energie)
and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund
- DGB) and several German courts for over ten years, the complainant explains
that in 1972 several trade unions affiliated to the DGB brought a lawsuit
before the labour courts of Herne for the withdrawal of its capacity to
conclude collective agreements, although this capacity had been granted
it on 20 March 1962 as a miners' trade union (Bergarbeiterverband - BAV)
by the same labour court in Herne.   The DAV, then called the BAV, lost
this suit.   The decision was confirmed by the labour court of the Land
of Hann in 1975 on the grounds that the criterion for a trade union organisation
to be able to bargain collectively should be that the said organisation
should be in a position to apply pressure within the limits of the legal
order, i.e. that it should be in a position to make the other party accept
collective bargaining.   The Federal Labour Court in 1978, then the Federal
Constitutional Court in 1981, rejected the appeals lodged by the DAV to
regain recognition of its capacity to conclude collective agreements.
Specifically, the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court stated
that the decision of the Federal Labour Court was constitutional, since
the DAV did not fulfil the minimum requirements for obtaining the capacity
to conclude collective agreements, and it decided that, as the request
only referred to recognition of the capacity to conclude collective agreements,
it was not necessary to rule on the question whether "the right of an association
to be recognised" guaranteed by article 9 of the Constitution authorised
a uniform interpretation of the concept of "trade union" in the Collective
Agreements Act and the Works Constitution Act.   The DAV considers that
this argument of the court is surprising, for it disregards the fact that
DAV had expressly requested a ruling on whether it "possessed the status
of trade union" in all respects.   According to the complainant, this decision
resulted in the loss of its status as a trade union under the terms of
the Works Constitution Act of 1972.

	317.	The complainant considers that the negative decision of the Federal
Constitutional Court is unjust, since the DAV should possess
the status
of trade union in all respects.   It therefore appealed to the European
Commission on Human Rights, which stated that its complaint was ill-founded.
However, according to the complainant, the withdrawal of recognition
of its status as a trade union, under the terms of the Works Constitution
Act, which resulted in the loss of all its trade union rights and the capacity
to act, violates the principles of freedom of association.

	318.	According to the complainant, the members of the DAV are defenceless
and exposed to the arbitrary action of the works councils held by the DGB.
They are at a disadvantage as regards nomination, transfer, promotion,
etc. and as the DAV is not a trade union under the terms of the Works Constitution
Act, it is not in a position to protect its members before the labour courts
against this kind of discrimination.   Neither is it in a position to represent
them before the labour courts at the Länder level.

	319.	The complainant supplied voluminous documentation in support of its
complaint, including the following:  a pamphlet giving an account of its
establishment in the mining sector in 1952; the 1962 court decision granting
it the right to bargain collectively in the mining sector;  its rules stating
that it covers workers in industry, commerce and handicrafts, as well as
those employed in the services, both in the public and private sectors;
opinions of German jurists supporting its request;  a letter prohibiting
the DAV from posting notices inside the Volkswagen enterprise in Wolfsburg
in 1980 on the grounds that it is not authorised to post notices in the
said establishment as it is not recognised as a trade union (this letter
informs the DAV representative who posted a notice that, if he continues
to post notices and disturb the peace in the enterprise, he will be dismissed
without notice);  a letter sent in 1976 by a certain Helmut Homan of the
Federation of Workers in Mining and Energy (IG Bergbau-Energie), forwarding
to the DAV five letters of resignation by workers from the complainant
(these resignations are drawn up on printed forms) and another letter of
resignation written by a certain Herbert Frase, dated 1983, in which he
informed the DAV that it had come to his knowledge that, contrary to the
latter's claim, the complainant was no longer a trade union by decision
of the Federal Constitutional Court and that he was therefore resigning.

	320.	The complainant concludes by appealing to the ILO for recognition
as a trade union under the terms of the Works Constitution Act of 1972.

B.
The Government's reply

	321.	The Government confirms in its reply that the Federal Labour Court,
in March 1978, rejected the appeal lodged by the DAV to be granted the
status of trade union and the capacity to bargain collectively on the grounds
that, for a workers' association to enjoy
the status of a trade union and
the capacity to bargain collectively, it must carry sufficient weight to
put pressure on, and resist pressure from, the opposing party so that negotiations
may generally result in a collective agreement (criterion of the capacity
of a trade union to obtain the acceptance of its claims).   The Government
also confirms that the Federal Constitutional Court rejected the appeal
of unconstitutionality lodged by the DAV against the decision of the Federal
Labour Court in October 1981.

	322.	According to the Government, the DAV is a workers' association whose
purpose is to guarantee and improve the economic and working conditions
of its constituents enshrined in section 9(3) of the Basic Law.   Therefore,
the DAV is free to act as a workers' association and, as such, is free
to submit complaints, elect its leadership, lodge appeals and recruit new
members, in conformity with the requirements of Convention No. 87.

	323.	Concerning the compaint that the members of the DAV are subjected
to discrimination, the Government explains that section 75 of the Works
Constitution Act obliges employers and works councils to ensure that every
person employed in the enterprise is treated in conformity with the principles
of law and equity and that there is no discrimination against any person,
in particular on account of their political or trade union activities or
convictions.   According to the Government, if a works council neglects
its duties or infringes its principles it renders itself liable, under
section 23(1) of the Works Constitution Act, to dissolution; likewise an
individual member guilty of such acts is liable to removal.

	324.	As regards the criteria for determining the representativity of a
trade union in order to grant it the capacity to bargain collectively,
the Government explains that such capacity is only conferred on associations
which fulfil the following conditions:  they must be autonomous in the
negotiation of wage rates and must consequently be in a position to regulate
conditions of employment by means of collective agreements and to maintain
industrial peace.   It is therefore necessary for the association concerned
to be able to win acceptance for its claims from the opposing party by
reason of the number of its members or by its position of strength in the
enterprise.   It must also carry enough weight to put pressure on, and
resist pressure from, the opposing party so that negotiations can generally
lead to the conclusion of collective agreements.

	325.	The Government recalls that the Committee on Freedom of Association
and the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations
have considered that legislation requiring that a trade union be representative
or competent in order to be able to bargain collectively is not contrary
to the principle of freedom of association if the determination of the
trade union in question is based on objective and pre-established criteria.
According to the Government, German legislation fulfils these conditions.
It adds that the decision to grant an association the capacity to bargain
collectively is a matter for the labour courts and
the DAV must apply again
to the courts for recognition of its capacity to bargain.

	326.	The Government also states that, under the terms of the Labour Courts
Act, independent associations of workers organised for social or occupational
purposes may bring their disputes before the labour courts or be represented
by lawyers.   It also includes with its reply extracts from the decision
of the Federal Labour Court of 14 March 1978 and from the decision of the
Federal Constitutional Court of 20 October 1981.

	327.	At the same time, the DGB sent its observations on this case at the
Government's request.   It considers that the right to set up organisations
for the purpose of defending and promoting the economic and working conditions
of every worker in every industry and in every occupation is guaranteed
by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany.   According to
the DGB, the DAV is a workers' association which enjoys the rights enshrined
in Articles 2 and 3 of Convention No. 87;  that association states that
it has existed for 30 years and has 14,000 members throughout the country.
No one prohibits it from carrying on its activities independently and
from representing the interests of its constituents vis-à-vis their employers,
affirms the DGB.

	328.	Concerning the discrimination alleged to have been suffered by members
of the DAV in enterprises where the works councils are held by other trade
union organisations, the DGB considers that, even if this were true, it
would not prove that the Federal Republic of Germany violated Convention
No. 87.   The Convention prohibits the public authorities from interfering
in matters of freedom of association but it contains no provision on the
behaviour to be adopted between workers who are members of rival organisations.
The DGB regrets that the DAV merely stated in general terms that its
members were defenceless and at the mercy of works councils held by the
DGB, and affirms that this allegation is unfounded.

	329.	The DGB further reiterates the information supplied by the Government
concerning the Works Constitution Act, which obliges works councils to
ensure that no "person employed in the establishment" is subjected to anti-
union discrimination, and which also provides that any infringement in
this respect would incur dissolution of the works council or removal of
the individual member guilty of such acts.

	330.	The DGB also reiterates the information supplied by the Government
as to the difference between a trade union with the capacity to bargain
collectively and a workers' association, and recalls that disputes on this
matter are settled by the courts on the basis of objective pre-established
criteria, i.e. the ability to put pressure on the opposing party and to
resist such pressure from the opposing party by reason of the number of
its members or its position of strength in labour relations.   However,
continues the DGB, as was admitted by the DAV, this association numbers
14,000 members throughout all the industrial and economic sectors of the
country,
while the DGB comprises 17 trade unions in the same sectors, with
8 million members.   In other words, the representativity of the DAV is
particularly weak.

	331.	The DGB adds that the DAV has never signed any collective agreement,
as was pointed out by the Federal Labour Court, but would like to be recognised
as a trade union with the capacity to bargain collectively so as to give
workers the impression that it is in a position to regulate their working
conditions by obtaining the establishment of legal provisions within the
German collective agreement system which would override the statutory provisions,
and that it does so, which is not the case.   Nevertheless, according to
the DGB, no one prevents the DAV from submitting complaints to the opposing
party or concluding collective agreements, but a workers' association must
be in a position to do so itself in full autonomy, and cannot demand that
its capacity in this respect, which is not borne out by the facts, be confirmed
by a court.

	332.	The DGB concludes that Conventions Nos. 87 and 98 have not been infringed
by the Federal Republic of Germany which, like other member States of the
ILO, only grants the capacity to bargain collectively to representative
or competent trade unions.

C.
The Committee's conclusions

	333.	The Committee observes that, in the present case, the complainant
has opposed a decision of the European Commission on Human Rights of Strasburg
and stated that it was lodging an appeal with the ILO against the said
decision.   The Committee, not being competent to examine the decisions
of other international or regional bodies, considers that this aspect of
the complaint is not receivable under the terms of the procedure in force.

	334.	As regards the substance of the case, the Committee observes that
it essentially involves a question of legal recognition of the status of
a trade union with the capacity to conclude collective agreements and the
negative consequences which the loss of such recognition entails.

	335.	The Committee has always considered that it is not necessarily incompatible
with Article 3 of Convention No. 87 (according to which workers' and employers'
organisations have the right to organise their administration and activities
and formulate their programmes without interference by the public authorities)
to provide for the issuance of a certificate to the most representative
trade union recognising it as an exclusive bargaining agent.   [See the
Committee on Freedom of Association, 67th Report, Case No. 303 (Ghana),
paras. 291 and 292.]

	336.	Nevertheless, the Committee has pointed out on several occasions
that where, according to the system in force, the most representative trade
union enjoys preferential or exclusive bargaining rights, it is important
that this trade union be determined on the basis of objective and pre-established
criteria in order to rule out any possibility of partiality or abuse.
[See the Committee on Freedom of Association, 92nd Report, Case No. 376
(Belgium), para. 31;  109th Report, Case No. 533 (India), para. 101;  202nd
Report, Case No. 949 (Malta), para. 278;  and 208th Report, Case No. 981
(Belgium), para. 113.]

	337.	In the case under consideration, the Committee observes that the
labour courts, including the highest court of the Federal Republic of Germany,
ruled on the basis of objective and pre-established criteria.   The Committee
has taken note, in particular, of the decision of the Federal Labour Court
of 14 March 1978 stating that the number of members of the DAV and the
structure of its organisation are insufficient for it to be recognised
as a trade union.   The distribution of its members is very dispersed and
it holds no key position in any sector.   In addition, its administration
is inadequate to enable it to carry on negotiations in areas as important
as mining and energy.   The Committee also observes that, as had been admitted
by the DAV, this workers' association only has 14,000 or 15,000 members
in all sectors of the economy throughout the country.   The DGB, on the
other hand, numbers 8 million workers in all sectors throughout the country.

	338.	In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the non-recognition
of the complainant as a trade union with the capacity to conclude collective
agreements, ruled by court decision, does not infringe the principles of
freedom association, the more so because this federation could apply again
to the court for recognition of its capacity to bargain if the situation
changed.

	339.	As regards the negative consequences entailed by the loss of this
recognition and, in particular, the prohibition on posting notices, incitements
to resign from the DAV on the grounds that this workers' association is
no longer a trade union, and the allegations of discrimination against
members of the DAV, the Committee points out the importance which it attaches
to the fact that the public authorities should guarantee that non-recognition
of a worker organisation's capacity to bargain does not result in that
trade union forfeiting the other rights which the minority workers' association
and its members should enjoy and the Government should protect the activities
that even a minority workers' association should be able to carry on in
order to further and defend the interests of its constituents in accordance
with Convention No. 87.

The Committee's recommendations

	340.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:

(a)
The Committee considers that the withdrawal of the status of a trade
union with a capacity to conclude collective agreements from the complainant
by court decision on the basis of objective and pre-established criteria
does not run counter to the principle of freedom of association.   The
Committee therefore considers that, on this point, there has been no infringement
of freedom of association.

(b)
However, the Committee draws the attention of the Government to the
fact that the public authorities must ensure that the withdrawal in question
does not result in this minority workers' association and its members forfeiting
the other rights which they should be able to enjoy in accordance with
Convention No. 87.

Case No. 1323

COMPLAINTS PRESENTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF
FREE TRADE UNIONS, THE TRADE UNIONS OF THE PHILIPPINES AND
ALLIED SERVICES AND THE KILUSANG MAYO UNO
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PHILIPPINES

	341.	The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented
a complaint of violations of trade union rights against the Government
of the Philippines on 7 March 1985.   The Trade Unions of the Philippines
and Allied Services (TUPAS) also addressed a complaint against the Government
in communications dated 13 and 29 May 1985, as did the Kilusang Mayo Uno
(KMU) in a communication dated 8 June 1985.   The Government sent its observations
in communications dated 30 May, 14 June and 26 August 1985.

	342.	The Philippines have ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection
of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) and the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98);  they have not ratified
the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention, 1978 (No. 151).

A.
The complainants' allegations

	343.	In its communication of 7 March 1985, the ICFTU states that it is
greatly concerned about restrictions relating to the right to strike, the
requirements for the registration of trade unions, the powers of inquiry
conferred on the Department of Labour in respect of the financial management
of unions and the harassment, arrest and detention of trade unionists in
the Philippines.   This has been reflected in the observations of the ILO
Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations
and by the Committee on Freedom of Association in its conclusions concerning
Cases Nos. 1157 and 1192.   In particular, the ICFTU alleges an additional
infringement of trade union rights by the Government, namely the denial
of the right to organise in the public sector.   According to the ICFTU,
while section 244 of the Labour Code guarantees the right to "self-organisation"
to workers in commercial, industrial and agricultural enterprises, the
workers in government and local government services, as well as workers
in government-owned or controlled corporations - covered by the Civil Service
Law and Rules - are excluded from the right to organise in trade unions.
This, states the ICFTU, results in a situation where a substantial proportion
of Filipino workers are without the protection and means for the furtherance
of their interests by trade union organisations.

	344.	In its communication of 13 May 1985, the TUPAS alleges that recent
legislation on strikes and lock-outs - Letter of Instruction No. 1458 promulgated
on 1 May 1985, a copy of which is supplied - weakens concerted actions,
strikes and picketing by workers, and is in violation of ILO Conventions.

	345.	In its communication of 29 May 1985, the TUPAS states that, although
Letter of Instruction No. 1458 has not at present been implemented, it
is contrary to the ILO Conventions on freedom of association for the following
reasons:  (1) it states that any assumption of jurisdiction by the President
or Minister of Labour shall be immediately executory even if such action
is under appeal to the Supreme Court;  (2) it empowers the Minister of
Labour to authorise the employer to hire replacement labour;  (3) the police
and military may be used for the immediate execution of orders even if
the Supreme Court should subsequently declare the action of the Minister
void.

	346.	In its communication of 8 June 1985, the KMU first alleges that the
following labour leaders were arrested on 13 August 1982 and remain detained
by the military authorities:  Romeo Castillo, Cesar Bristol, Danilo Garcia,
Herminia Ibarra (all detained at Military Camp Bagong Diwa), Millet Soriano,
José Britanico, Simplicio Anino, Lauro Pabit (all detained at Military
Camp Crame), Ceferino Pineda, Antonio Cabrera, Renato Yineda, Roberto Ramos
and Noel Maglalang (all detained at Military Camp Olivas).   According
to the KMU, they were charged with offences which they have not committed.

	347.	Secondly, the KMU alleges that the major labour laws are repressive
and violate the ILO Constitution and freedom of association Conventions.
For example, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining
are restricted in the following circumstances:  (a) government employees,
including employees working in quasi-public corporations, are not allowed
to organise as labour organisations and are prohibited from declaring a
strike or engaging in other concerted activities.   Their security of tenure
and other terms and conditions of employment are governed by the Philippine
Civil Service Laws which are unilaterally imposed by the Government.
Prior to martial law in the Philippines, the rights of public employees
to organise in quasi-public corporations had been recognised;  (b) workers
in the following industries are allowed to organise labour unions but are
prohibited from declaring a strike or engaging in concerted activities
pursuant to section 264(g) of the Labor Code, Legislative Resolution No.
473 and Executive Order No. 815:  export-oriented industries, semi-conductor
business, public utilities, companies engaged in the generation or distribution
of energy, banks and hopsitals;  (c) the following are not allowed to unionise:
private security guards, personnel employed by the employers for the protection
and security of their person, properties and the factory, managerial employees,
casual, probationary and temporary employees, apprentices, learners and
contractual workers.

	348.	The KMU alleges in this connection that freedom of association is
curtailed by the Government by not according to a labour organisation the
status of a legitimate labour organisation unless it registers with the
Ministry of Labour and Employment.   For example, KMU is refused recognition
by the Government because it is not a registered labour centre despite
clear and unequivocal acceptance by the Filipino workers of its legitimacy.
Moreover, undue delays in the handling of union representation cases
affects the rights of the workers to form an association.   For example,
a simple election case can last for more than one year thereby frustrating
the free choice of bargaining agents.   Related to this are the stringent
requirements imposed by the Government for the registration of labour unions
(section 234 of the Labour Code) and labour federations and national unions
(section 237 of the Labour Code:  a labour federation or national union
cannot be registered unless the applicant presents proof that ten local
unions with collective bargaining agreements are affiliated to the federation).

	349.	The KMU also refers to section 6 of Presidential Decree No. 1391
by which workers are prohibited from changing their bargaining agent during
the life of a collective bargaining contract which is fixed at three years.
Consequently, even if the bargaining agent selected no longer enjoys
the trust and confidence of the workers, the latter have to wait for three
years before the bargaining representative could be changed.

	350.	The KMU next refers to section 4(f) of Rule III of the Rules Implementing
Presidential Decree No. 1391 which reads:  "... No person who is not an
employee or worker of the company or establishment where
an independently
registered union, affiliate, local or chapter of a labour federation or
national union operates shall henceforth be elected or appointed as an
officer of such union, affiliate, local or chapter."   This rule, according
to the KMU, prohibits a person not employed by the company from becoming
a union officer.

	351.	According to the KMU, freedom of association is also violated by
the Government because it is empowered by law (sections 238, 239 and 240
of the Labour Code) to cancel the registration certificates of labour unions
for the following reasons:  fraud in connection with the ratification of
the union's constitution;  failure to submit the founding documents within
30 days from their adoption;  fraud during elections or failure to submit
election information within 30 days of the election;  failure to submit
annual returns within 30 days of the close of the financial year;  engaging
in any activity prohibited by law;  entering into collective agreements
setting conditions of employment below the minimum legal standards;  asking
for or accepting special fees from employers or union members;  failure
to submit membership lists at least once a year.

	352.	Lastly, the KMU alleges that from January to May 1985 there has been
an upsurge in trade union repression, involving the death of at least nine
workers while actively representing their unions.   This complainant states
that on 1 May 1985 the President issued Letter of Instruction No. 1458
which provides for the immediate involvement of the military in picket
lines.   It claims that the use of fanatic groups, para-military and direct
military intervention in strike situations is obvious.

	353.	The KMU attaches to its communication a voluminous petition containing
further details regarding alleged violations of Conventions Nos. 87 and
98 and requesting the ILO to instruct the Government to stay the implementation
of Labour Laws Nos. 130 and 227, Executive Order No. 815, Resolution No.
473 and Letter of Instruction No. 1458.   In addition to repeating the
detailed allegations listed above, the petition refers specifically to
undue employer and government interference in the internal activities of
unions by requiring a majority of two-thirds votes before concerted action
can be authorised and by permitting their representatives to attend and/or
supervise union meetings.

	354.	According to the KMU petition, rather than heed the criticisms of
several international bodies, the Government issued Letter of Instruction
No. 1458.   This legislation was used to put down a strike by 800 employees
of the Filipinas Synthetic Fiber Corporation at Santa Rosa, Laguna, with
resulting injuries to 70 strikers.   While this legislation requires the
employer to comply with a return-to-work order, the KMU alleges that some
do not immediately reinstate striking employees, e.g. Baxter Travenol,
Allied Banking Corporation, Blue Bar Coconut and the Producers Bank.
In addition, while the Letter of Instruction requires the payment of back
wages to striking employees, the Minister of Labour does not order such
repayment.

	355.	The KMU also attaches to its complaint a copy of a petition it presented
on 10 June 1985 to the Supreme Court of the Philippines requesting the
issuance of a temporary restraining order against implementation of Letter
of Instruction No. 1458 until the Court can decide that it is invalid and
unconstitutional.

B.
The Government's reply

	356.	In its communication of 30 May 1985, the Government explains that
although both private sector and government employees are guaranteed the
right to association, government employees performing governmental functions
were in the past the only group not allowed to engage in concerted activities.
When the situation emerged where employees of government-owned or controlled
corporations engaged in proprietary functions received wages and benefits
far higher than their counterparts in the various branches of Government,
it was decided to include such employees within the ambit of the Civil
Service Act of 1959.   As a result of debates on this point during the
adoption of the 1973 Constitution, section 1, Article XII-B, was passed,
placing these employees under the Civil Service Act and providing that
compensation of all government employees shall be standardised by the National
Assembly.   The Government points out that section 277 of the Labour Code
incorporated the constitutional provision in the following terms:

	The terms and conditions of employment of all government employees, including
employees of all government-owned or controlled corporations shall be governed
by the Civil Service Law, rules and regulations.   Their salaries shall
be standardised by the National Assembly as provided for in the new Constitution.
However, there shall be no reduction of existing wages, benefits, and
other terms and conditions of employment being enjoyed by them at the time
of the adoption of the Code.

	357.	According to the Government, the phrase "government-owned or controlled
corporations" has been interpreted by the Secretary (now Minister) of Justice
and the National Labour Relations Commission (NLRC) of the Ministry of
Labour and Employment as contemplating only those created by charter or
by special laws or decrees.   It does not include corporations incorporated
or organised under the Corporation Code of the Philippines and motivated
wholly for profit and the promotion of private interests.   Hence, eventual
government takeover through the acquisition of a controlling bloc of shares
does not affect existing unions and collective bargaining agreements within
the undertaking.

	358.	The Government stresses that there is no law in the country that
restricts the right to organise of government employees.   On the contrary,
the right to organise is guaranteed by the Constitution.
Thus, in a case
filed by the Alliance of Government Workers in 1983, the Supreme Court
ruled:

	... Our dismissal of this petition should not, by any means, be interpreted
to imply that workers in government-owned and controlled corporations,
or in state colleges and universities, may not enjoy freedom of association.
The workers whom the petitioner purports to represent have the right,
which may not be abridged, to form associations or societies for purposes
not contrary to law.   This is a right they share with all public officers
and employees and, in fact, by everybody living in this country.   But
they may not join associations which impose the obligation to engage in
concerted activities in order to get salaries, fringe benefits, and other
emoluments higher than or different from that provided by law and regulations.

That government employees can and do form associations of their own choosing
to promote and protect their collective interests is evidenced by such
organisations as the Philippine Government Employees' Association (PGEA),
the Alliance of Government Workers (AGW), the Philippine Public School
Teachers' Association (PPSTA), the Labor Arbiters' Association of the Philippines,
Inc. (LAAPI), the Philippine Veterans Bank Employees' Union (PVBEU) and
various co-operatives and trade organisations in the public sector.

	359.	Referring to the alleged limitation on the exercise of the right
to strike in government-owned and controlled corporations, the Government
explains that prior to the promulgation of the 1973 Constitution, employees
of such corporations performing proprietary functions could join a union
that imposed the duty to strike and other similar concerted actions.
In practice, however, labour disputes involving government-owned or controlled
corporations were considered imbued with national interest and were often
recommended by the then Secretary of Labour to be certified by the President
to the Court of Industrial Relations for compulsory arbitration under the
legislation then in force.   The Government states that the constitutional
provision is not absolute in that it refers only to those corporations
with special charters.   Thus, corporations organised by the Government
or those incorporated under the Corporation Act continue to enjoy the right
to collective bargaining and concerted activities.   Among these corporations
are the Philippine Airlines, Petrophil and Hyatt Regency Hotel, in which
their employees are not only unionised, but also have existing collective
agreements with them.

	360.	According to the Government, the rights and interests of government
workers are protected by Executive Order No. 895 of 1 May 1983.   This
directive provides for the creation of an Employee-Management Committee
in every government-owned or controlled corporation and  an Employee-Management
Consultative Council in the Civil Service Commission.   The Government
recognises that the formation of these bodies is crucial in view of the
limitations on the right to bargain collectively regarding wages and strike
actions.   Executive Order No. 895 aims at fostering closer and more harmonious
employer-employee relations in government-owned or controlled corporations.
The Committee and the Council are intended to improve the existing framework
for the expeditious settlement of grievances and in providing a forum for
regular and meaningful dialogue between the parties.   "Grievances" as
used in Executive Order No. 895, are defined as problems arising from physical
working conditions, placement of employees, work distribution, performance
appraisal, arbitrary actions, lay-offs and transfers, selection and promotion
and other matters that may give rise to employee dissatisfaction.   The
rules governing operation of the employee-management committees provide
that these shall be composed of equal representation of managment and workers.
The Council, on the other hand, shall be composed of permanent representatives
from the Employee-Management Committee which has referred a grievance to
the Council and a representative from the ministry and agency to which
the corporation involved is attached.

	361.	The Government admits, however, that despite the administrative and
judicial pronouncements regarding the right to self-organisation, some
sectors continue to call for clarificatory legislation.   In view of this,
Parliamentary Bill No. 4962 was filed on 25 February 1985 proposing several
amendments to the Labour Code.   Among the proposed amendments is a provision
which, while still prohibiting strikes in the public sector, recognises
the right of this class of employees to bargain collectively with their
employers and seeks to extend to them the same rights and privileges enjoyed
by private sector employees.   A current review is also being undertaken
by the Cabinet in line with the Supreme Court decision on the matter.

	362.	To its communication dated 14 June 1985, the Government attaches
a copy of the "Guide-lines to implement Letter of Instruction No. 1458"
dated 31 May 1985.   The "Guide-lines" include safeguards such as exhaustion
of conciliation or mediation before certifying the dispute to the National
Labour Relations Commission for compulsory arbitration, the right to peaceful
picketting and a restriction on the role of law enforcement authorities
in labour disputes.

	363.	In its letter of 26 August 1985, the Government first observes that
many of the issues raised in the present complaint have already been examined
by both the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Committee of Experts;
it accordingly refers to its past replies on these issues.

	364.	The Government states that, on 20 August 1985, Millet Soriano, Simplicio
Anino, Lauro Pabit and José Britanico were released from detention on bail.
They are being tried for conspiracy to commit rebellion or insurrection,
illegal possession of explosives and violation of Presidential Decree No.
33.   The Government also states that, according to documentation at the
Ministry of National Defence, the other militant labour leaders were arrested
not for legitimate trade union activity but for subversive and illegal
acts;  they are charged with illegal possession of firearms and ammunition
and incitement to sedition, rebellion or insurrection.

	365.	As regards the allegations concerning the labour legislation, the
Government points to the following recent developments:

-
the first meeting, on 20 February 1985, of the Tripartite Discussion
Series on Labour and Employment Issues, during which the KMU, TUPAS and
other workers' organisations were able to present their recommendations
on the subject of arbitration to be included in the Ministry's Study Team
review of labour laws, which is expected to hand down its final recommendations
very soon;

-
a public hearing, on 8 August 1985, on a draft bill (No. 4962) to amend
the Labour Code incorporating some of the provisions referred to by the
Committee of Experts;

-
a National Tripartite Conference, to be held in September 1985, to discuss
all possible amendments to labour legislation.

	366.	More particularly, the Government explains that Letter of Instruction
No. 1458 was prompted by the open defiance of both labour and management
sectors of lawful orders issued by the Ministry of Labour.   Although issued
in good faith by the Government, it is being included in the on-going review
of labour relations laws in view of the varied reactions from both labour
and management.

C.
The Committee's conclusions

	367.	The Committee notes that four of the labour leaders listed by the
KMU have been released from detention on bail pending trial on charges
unrelated to their trade union functions or activities.   Given that the
complainant did not attempt to link these arrests to the trade union activities
of those concerned and merely referred to "an upsurge of trade union repression
involving the death of at least nine workers" without supplying further
details, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not
call for further examination.

	368.	Voluminous detail was provided by both sides on the alleged legislative
violations of Conventions Nos. 87 and 98.   The ICFTU and KMU allege that
public employees covered by the Civil Service Law and Rules are excluded
from the right to organise in trade unions, cannot bargain collectively
or strike.   The Government explains why civil servants and employees of
government-owned or controlled corporations are subject to the same restrictions
and points out that the latter (as well as teachers), by virtue of a Supreme
Court ruling, may join associations which do not impose the obligation
to strike.   They can also discuss working conditions and grievances through
the Employee/Management Consultative Council.   The Government also points
out that a distinction has been made whereby employees of those
para-public
corporations not set up by special charter continue to enjoy the right
to bargain collectively and strike in the same manner as private sector
workers.

	369.	The Committee notes that the Committee of Experts, commenting on
the question of the right to organise of public employees, has stated that,
since they do have the right to form associations under the Civil Service
Law, they are therefore not denied the rights guaranteed by Article 2 of
Convention No. 87.   Problems, however, arise under Convention No. 98 in
that freedom to bargain collectively is restricted for a very broadly defined
group of public servants.   As has been pointed out to the Government in
comments by the Committee of Experts under Convention No. 98 since 1981,
Article 4 thereof concerning the encouragement and promotion of collective
bargaining applies both to the private sector and to public undertakings
and bodies, it being possible under Article 6 to exclude from such application
only public servants engaged in the administration of the State, i.e. civil
servants employed in various capacities in government ministries and other
comparable bodies.   The Committee accordingly trusts that the current
high-level revision of the labour laws will take this principle into account
and requests the Government to keep the Committee of Experts on the Application
of Conventions and Recommendations informed of developments as regards
permitting public employees in both para-public corporations set up by
charter and non-civil-service posts to negotiate their terms and conditions
of employment.

	370.	A related issue is raised by the KMU which refers to various Labour
Code restrictions on private-sector unionisation (e.g., it is not available
for private security guards, managerial employees, casual, probationary,
temporary and contractual workers) and on the right to strike in the private
sector (prohibited in export-oriented industries, semi-conductor business,
public utilities, banks, hospitals).   The Committee recalls that the Committee
of Experts, in its 1981 observation concerning the Philippines' application
of Convention No. 87, noted the Government's explanation that security
staff have para-military status and are required to undergo pre-employment
training under the direct supervision of the Philippine Constabulary.
At the same time the Committee of Experts noted the restrictive definition
of "managerial employee" and did not pursue the matter since such employees
were free to form their own organisations for purposes other than for collective
bargaining.   The Committee observes, as regards casual or probationary
workers, that there is no specific provision in the Labour Code (1985 Consolidation)
denying apprentices or learners the right to join a union.   Moreover,
section 244 of the Code specifically recognises the right of "ambulant,
intermittent and itinerant workers, self-employed people, rural workers
and those without any definite employers" to form labour organisations.
The Committee accordingly considers that this aspect of the case does
not call for further examination.

	371.	The ban on the right to strike in some private sector activities
has, however, been criticised by this Committee and the
Committee of Experts
in the past.   Although the 1985 observation by the Committee of Experts
under Convention No. 87 noted that legal strikes had in practice taken
place in banks, electric industries and export-processing zones, the Government's
attention was again drawn to the principle that strikes can only be restricted
or prohibited in respect of the civil service or essential services in
the strict sense of the term, i.e. where the interruption of such activities
would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part
of the population.   The Committee again trusts that the current review
of labour legislation will result in amendments being adopted in the light
of the foregoing principle to limit the excessive restrictions on the right
to strike.

	372.	As regards the KMU's further criticisms of labour legislation (too
detailed regulation of registration of labour unions and federations;
three-year limit for changing a bargaining agent;  ban on holding union
office on a person not belonging to the company involved;  wide range of
reasons for the cancellation of registration certificates;  the two-third
vote requirement for strike action), the Committee recalls once again that
the ILO supervisory bodies have previously criticised these restrictions
and has called for their amendment.   The Committee can only reiterate
this request, and hopes that these points will be considered during the
current review referred to above.

	373.	Lastly, as regards Letter of Instruction No. 1458 of 1 May 1985,
the Committee notes that, according to one complainant, it has not as yet
been used and that the Ministry of Labour has issued "Guide-lines" emphasising
voluntary settlement of labour disputes before referral to compulsory arbitration
and restricting the role of law enforcement authorities.   Moreover, the
"Guide-lines" provide for the specification of legal sanctions in the event
of failure to comply with an arbitration order, such as non-payment of
back wages.   The Committee attaches great importance to the "Guide-lines"
of the Ministry of Labour and emphasises that any hasty decision to refer
disputes to compulsory arbitration is not in conformity with these "Guide-lines".
It observes that the Government has responded to the varied reactions
from labour and management to this Letter of Instruction by including it
in the current review of labour relations laws.   The Committee requests
the Government to keep the Committee of Experts informed of any developments
concerning this legislation.

The Committee's recommendations

	374.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions:

(a)
Given the lack of detail on and substantiation of the alleged arrest
of several labour leaders for trade union activities, the
Committee considers
that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
(b)
As regards the legislative aspects of this case, the Committee recalls
the conclusions of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions
and Recommendations to the effect that public servants do have the right
to form associations under the Civil Service Law, but that the restriction
on the right to bargain collectively placed on such public employees goes
beyond the exclusion permitted by Article 6 of Convention No. 98.

(c)
In view of the conclusions reached by the Committee of Experts on the
alleged restriction of freedom of association for private security guards,
managerial employees and casual and probationary employees, the Committee
is of the opinion that this aspect of the case does not call for further
examination.

(d)
As regards the ban on the right to strike in certain private sector
activities, the Committee once again draws the Government's attention to
the principle that strikes can only be restricted or prohibited in respect
of the civil service or essential services in the strict sense of the term.

(e)
As regards the remaining criticisms in the current labour legislation
as well as Letter of Instruction No. 1458, the Committee notes that a high-level
review of labour relations legislation is presently under way and that
a draft bill is before Parliament incorporating some of the provisions
referred to by ILO supervisory bodies.   The Committee trusts that this
review will take into account all the comments of the supervisory bodies.

(f)
The Committee draws the legislative matters raised in subparagraphs
(b), (d) and (e) of this case to the attention of the Committee of Experts
on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and hopes that the
Government will keep that Committee informed of developments concerning
the labour laws as a whole.

Case No. 1324

COMPLAINTS PRESENTED BY THE WORLD CONFEDERATION OF ORGANISATIONS
OF THE TEACHING PROFESSION, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLERICAL
OFFICERS' ASSOCIATION, AGE, THE AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL OF TRADE
UNIONS AND THE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC SERVICE ASSOCIATION (4TH DIVISION
OFFICERS) AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA/NORTHERN TERRITORY

	375.	The World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession
(WCOTP) presented a complaint of violations of trade union
rights against
the Government of Australia/Northern Territory in communications dated
21 March and 7 May 1985.   The Administrative and Clerical Officers' Association,
AGE (ACOA), the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the Australian
Public Service Association (4th Division Officers) (APSA) sent similar
complaints in communications dated, respectively, 23 April and 7 June,
9 May and 11 June 1985.   The Government replied in a letter dated 26 August
1985.

	376.	Australia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection
of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98);  it has not ratified
the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention, 1978 (No. 151).

A.
The complainants' allegations

	377.	In its letters of 21 March and 7 May 1985, the WCOTP alleges that
the Government of Australia/Northern Territory has undertaken reprisals
- in the form of suppression of the check-off system - against lawful industrial
action by its affiliate, the Northern Territory Teachers' Federation (NTTF).
The WCOTP explains the background to this action as follows:  on 15 August
1984 the NT Government unilaterally decided to alter housing arrangements
for teachers and other public servants;  one meeting took place on 24 August
with the Government but the Housing Minister and Treasurer announced that
the NT Government would not move from its new position;  on 28 August the
NTTF and eight other public employees unions staged a one-day strike to
press for negotiations on the issue;  since no negotiations ensued the
NTTF recommended to its members, on 27 September, a series of bans on extra-curricular
activities, designed not to affect the provision of teaching services during
school hours;  after one school excursion had to be cancelled, the NTTF
was informed on 11 October 1984 that payroll deductions would cease unless
industrial action stopped the next day;  on 12 October the NTTF was told
that the cessation would take place with effect as from next pay day i.e.
19 October;  on 24 October the bans were lifted since a meeting to commence
discussions with the Government had been arranged;  on 1 February 1985
the NTTF met the NT Minister of Education who refused to discuss the restoration
of the check-off.

	378.	According to the WCOTP, the rapidity with which government action
was taken left no time to work out alternative methods of collection of
membership dues.   It points out that the NTTF was paying an agreed amount
for the service of payroll deductions (over A$9,000 per annum).   It considers
that the cancellation of the check-off seriously impairs the conditions
in which its affiliate carries on its work, particularly in view of the
geographical circumstances of the Northern Territory where a sparse population
is served in areas remote from the capital city, Darwin.   Since nearly
all NTTF members paid their subscriptions in the form of payroll
deductions,
the immediate effect of the removal of this system was a drop in membership
from 1,860 to 56.   The WCOTP explains that, through an alternative service
agency, the NTTF has been able to regain membership dues for some 1,300
members but it fears that the NTTF will suffer financially from the withdrawal
of payroll deductions and be impaired in its functioning and programmes.
Given the employer's continued refusal to negotiate this issue, there
is a risk of deterioration in the relationship between the NTTF and the
Government.

	379.	In its communications of 23 April and 7 June 1985, the ACOA explains
that its members were also affected by the NT Government's unilateral change
in public servant housing arrangements and, along with many other unions,
joined in the 24-hour strike of 28 August and later joined in the work
bans, which affected overtime, ministerial correspondence etc.   The Government
withdrew payroll deduction facilities for ACOA and APSA members on 20 September
1985 (after only two days' warning) but not from the other unions.   The
work bans were lifted on 24 September 1984 but the Government has maintained
its refusal to reinstate the check-off.   The ACOA states that this has
placed severe financial pressure on itself and the other unions involved,
particularly because they operate in some of the remotest areas of Australia
where it is impossible to collect union subscriptions by any means other
than payroll deductions.   The ACOA points out that it has 1,341 members
in the NT, which reflects a fall of 80 since the withdrawal of the check-off.

	380.	The ACTU, in its letter of 9 May 1985, supports the complaint of
the NTTF because it considers the NT Government's action as a reprisal
to lawful industrial action and as a hastily used weapon.   Given the serious
adverse effect of the withdrawal of the check-off on the financial and
organisational ability of the unions involved and the refusal of the employer
to discuss its restoration, the ACTU believes that this action is an attempt
by the Government to weaken a legally registered workers' organisation.

	381.	The APSA, in its communication of 11 June 1985, also supports the
NTTF's complaint.

B.
The Government's reply

	382.	In its letter of 26 August 1985, the Government explains that the
NT Government's decision to withdraw payroll deduction of union dues on
19 October 1984 took place against a background of continuing industrial
action by NTTF, ACOA and APSA members in protest over the Government's
budgetary decision to alter the housing and accommodation policy and practice
as from 1 August 1984.   According to the Government, despite a number
of meetings in September with the Treasurer and the Public Service Commissioner
after which the NT Government announced a change in its original decision
in order to
protect public servants on low incomes, the industrial action
continued.   Payroll deductions were discontinued on 20 September and the
ACOA and APSA lifted their bans on 24 September.   On the other hand, NTTF
members continued their bans on all non-teaching activities, upon which
the Education Department decided to cease its payroll deduction facilities
as of 12 October (effective 19 October);  teachers' industrial action only
ceased on 24 October.

	383.	The Government stresses that the check-off was discontinued only
after a period of warning, and did not apply to all NT workers' organisations
originally involved in the dispute (i.e. only to the NTTF, ACOA and APSA).
It also points out that in August 1979, in another matter, the ACOA had
sought an injunction in the High Court of Australia restraining the cessation
of payroll deductions on the grounds of breach of contract;  the Court
had dismissed the claim as evidence from the documents indicated that the
facility resulted from the making of an administrative agreement.

C.
The Committee's conclusions

	384.	The Committee notes that the issue in this case concerns the withdrawal
of check-off facilities in response to continuing industrial action by
public employees' unions.   It recalls that it has examined analogous allegations
against the Government of Australia in the past.   [See 204th Report, Case
No. 902, paras. 135 to 147.]   In that case, the Committee stated that
the withdrawal of the check-off facility, which could lead to financial
difficulties for trade union organisations, was not conducive to the development
of harmonious industrial relations and should therefore be avoided.   The
Committee considers that the same principle applies to the present case.

	385.	The Committee also notes the on-going refusal of the NT Government
to discuss the possible restoration of the check-off facility with the
unions concerned.   It expresses the wish that efforts will be made by
the parties, on the basis of an agreement, to restore the check-off facility
previously available to the unions.

The Committee's recommendations

	386.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve this report and, in particular, the following conclusions:

(a)
The Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle - as
it has done in an analogous case in the past - that the withdrawal of the
check-off facility, which could lead to
financial difficulties for the
unions involved, is not conducive to the development of harmonious industrial
relations.
(b)
The Committee expresses the wish that efforts will be made by the parties,
on the basis of an agreement, to restore the check-off facility previously
available to the unions.

CASES IN WHICH THE COMMITTEE REQUESTS TO BE
KEPT INFORMED OF DEVELOPMENTS

Case No. 1189

COMPLAINTS PRESENTED BY THE PUBLIC SERVICES
INTERNATIONAL AND THE ORGANISATION OF AFRICAN
TRADE UNION UNITY AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF KENYA

	387.	The Committee last examined this case at its February 1985 meeting
when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body [238th Report,
paras. 248 to 260].   Further information was received from the Government
in a communication dated 6 September 1985.

	388.	Kenya has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection
of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) or the Labour Relations
(Public Service) Convention, 1978 (No. 151);  it has ratified the Right
to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
Previous examination of the case

	389.	When it presented its interim report to the Governing Body in February
1985 the Committee made the following recommendations:

	(a)
The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principle
that public servants, like all other workers without distinction whatsoever,
have the right to form and join organisations of their own choosing, without
previous authorisation, for the promotion and defence of their occupational
interests.

	(b)
The Committee considers that a welfare association, such as that envisaged
by the Government, would not fully afford to the civil servants concerned
an adequate means to protect and defend their occupational interests.
	(c)
The Committee requests the Government to supply full and detailed information
on the measures that have been taken, or are envisaged, to permit the establishment
of an organisation through which the workers concerned may pursue their
normal trade union activities.

	(d)
The Committee requests the Government to transmit information on the
question of the assets that were seized on the deregistration of the civil
servants' organisation, and on the Government's intention as to the manner
in which it is proposed to distribute these assets.

B.
Further reply by the Government

	390.	In a communication dated 6 September 1985, the Government states
that the Kenya Civil Servants' Welfare Association has been registered
under the Societies Act.   It adds that, although the Association has not
been allowed to participate in activities of a trade union nature, the
gesture entailed in the registration is a good beginning and should be
given a chance to operate.   Attached to the reply of the Government was
an extract from the constitution of the Association containing, inter alia,
the objects and membership clauses thereof.

C.
The conclusions of the Committee

	391.	The Committee deeply deplores that the Government has not taken into
account the recommendations adopted by the Governing Body at its 229th
Session in February 1985, and that its most recent communication does little
more than confirm that the situation in respect of which recommendations
were made continues to exist.

	392.	The Committee regrets, in particular, the failure of the Government
to supply any information on measures which have been taken or which may
be envisaged to permit the establishment of organisations through which
the workers in question may pursue their normal trade union activities
and it regards as especially regrettable the Government's affirmation that
the Kenya Civil Servants' Welfare Association has not been allowed to participate
in activities of a trade union nature.

	393.	In the circumstances, the Committee draws the attention of the Government
once again to the importance of the principle that public servants, like
all other workers, without distinction, have the right to form and join
organisations of their own choosing, without previous authorisation, for
the promotion and defence of their occupational interests.   It urges the
Government to take the steps
necessary to give effect to this principle
and thus to restore to the civil servants concerned the rights which they
enjoyed prior to the Government's action of 17 February 1983 deregistering
the Kenya Civil Servants' Association.

	394.	The Committee also notes with regret that the Government has failed
to respond to the request for information concerning the assets which were
seized when the Kenya Civil Servants' Association was deregistered.   In
this regard, it draws the attention of the Government to the principle
that when a trade union is dissolved, its assets should eventually be distributed
among its former members or handed over to the organisation which succeeds
it;  by this is meant the organisation or organisations which pursue the
aims for which the dissolved union was established and which pursue them
in the same spirit.   The Committee expresses disquiet at the absence of
any indications that the Government intends to put this principle into
effect and calls upon it to do so.

The Committee's recommendations

	395.	The Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report
and, in particular, the following conclusions:

(a)
The Committee deeply deplores that the Government has not taken into
account the recommendations adopted by the Governing Body at its 229th
Session in February 1985.   Its most recent communication confirms the
situation which gave rise to the complaints.

(b)
The Committee regrets the failure of the Government to supply any information
on measures which have been taken or which may be envisaged to permit the
establishment of organisations through which the civil servants in question
may pursue their normal trade union activities, especially since the Kenya
Civil Servants' Welfare Association has not been allowed to participate
in activities of a trade union nature.

(c)
The Committee draws the attention of the Government once again to the
importance of the principle that public servants, like all other workers,
without distinction, have the right to form and join organisations of their
own choosing, without previous authorisation, for the promotion and defence
of their occupational interests.

(d)
The Committee further notes with regret that the Government has failed
to respond to the request of the Governing Body for information concerning
the assets which were seized when it was deregistered.
(e)
The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principle
that when a trade union is dissolved, its assets should be distributed
among its former members or handed over to the organisation or organisations
which succeed it:  by this is meant those organisations which pursue the
aims for which the dissolved union was established and which pursue them
in the same spirit.

(f)
The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any action
it takes in respect of the above recommendations.

Cases No. 1277 and 1288

COMPLAINTS PRESENTED BY SEVERAL REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL
TRADE UNION ORGANISATIONS, NAMELY:  THE INTER-AMERICAN REGIONAL
ORGANISATION OF WORKERS, THE LATIN AMERICAN CONFEDERATION OF WORKERS,
THE PERMANENT CONGRESS OF TRADE UNION UNITY OF LATIN AMERICAN
WORKERS, THE WORLD FEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS, THE INTERNATIONAL
CONFEDERATION OF FREE TRADE UNIONS, THE WORLD CONFEDERATION OF LABOUR
AND BY SEVERAL DOMINICAN TRADE UNION ORGANISATIONS, NAMELY:
THE GENERAL WORKERS' FEDERATION, THE NATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF
DOMINICAN WORKERS, THE GENERAL UNION OF DOMINICAN WORKERS, THE UNIFIED
WORKERS CENTRAL AND THE WORKERS' TRADE UNION AUTONOMOUS FEDERATION
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

	396.	The Committee examined these cases at its November 1984 Session and
submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see 236th Report of
the Committee, paras. 651-685, approved by the Governing Body at its 228th
Session (November 1984)].   Later, the Government transmitted certain observations
by a communication dated 28 May 1985.

	397.	The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and
Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) and the Right
to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
Previous examination of the cases

	398.	These cases concern essentially the serious incidents which occurred
during days of protest in April and May 1984 which had been organised by
the five Dominican trade union central organisations grouped together under
the Trade Union Council against the very large increase in the cost of
living following the agreement signed between the Dominican Government
and the International Monetary Fund at the end of April 1984.

	399.	The numbers of dead and injured reported by the complainant organisations
differed.   According to ORIT and ICFTU, 65 workers had died and 600 had
been injured.   According to WCL, there had been 37 dead and 157 injured.
According to WFTU, more than 100 deaths had been recorded.

	400.	The Government had stated in particular that on 23, 24 and 25 April
1984 violent public demonstrations had occurred both in the capital and
the interior of the country;  these had included, in particular, the sacking
and burning of public and private property and flagrant acts of aggression
against the authorities responsible for keeping the peace.   Acting within
the limits of the law, the authorities had resisted these attacks which
unfortunately resulted in the death and injury of several persons.   The
Government stated that the action of the armed forces and the police had
not been directed against any particular sector, whether trade unions,
students or other citizens.

	401.	When the Committee examined the cases at its November 1984 Session
the allegations relating to the deaths and injuries suffered during the
aforementioned days of protest were left pending.   The Committee formulated
in particular the following recommendations:

The Committee expresses its deep concern at the scope and seriousness of
the allegations made in these cases and which concern the death and injury
of several persons during trade union protest demonstrations against major
increases in the cost of living.

As regards the violent deaths and injury of a number of persons, the Committee
recalls the importance of carrying out a thorough inquiry to determine
responsibilities so as to prevent a repetition of such actions;  it requests
the Government to inform it of the outcome of such an inquiry.

B.
The Government's reply

	402.	In its communication dated 28 May 1985 the Government states that
the complainant trade union central organisations claim to have sponsored
the protest movements staged on 23, 24 and 25 April 1984;  this is not
in accordance with the truth, for the whole country is aware that those
movements were not organised by those trade union organisations and that,
on the contrary, they showed that they had been taken by surprise in not
knowing the origin or leadership of the movements or the forces behind
them;  consequently, this aspect of the matter is outside the trade union
framework.

	403.	The Government adds that the protest movements in question were in
reality a rebellion against the legally established order which the forces
of law and order, exercising their statutory powers,
proceeded to repel.
As a result of those circumstances, it is impossible to establish guilt,
chiefly that of the unknown instigators and ringleaders who took advantage
of the discontent prevailing among the masses of the people at that moment,
in an endeavour to capitalise on it in favour of their own political interests.

C.
The Committee's conclusions

	404.	The Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government
concerning the dead and injured during the protest movements of 23, 24
and 25 April 1984.   The Committee notes, in particular, that according
to the Government, it is impossible to establish guilt, in particular that
of the unknown instigators and ringleaders who took advantage of the discontent
prevailing among the masses of the people at that moment, in an endeavour
to capitalise on it in favour of their own political interests.

	405.	In this connection, the Committee, notwithstanding that there may
be difficulty in fixing responsibility for the deaths and physical attacks
which occurred during the protest movements, wishes to point out that the
Government has stated that several deaths and injuries occurred when the
authorities responsible for keeping the peace, acting within the limits
of the law, resisted flagrant acts of aggression and other criminal acts
such as the sacking and burning of property.  In these circumstances, the
Committee considers that it would be possible to carry out a thorough and
impartial inquiry into the nature of the demonstrations and the deaths
and physical attacks which occurred, in order to determine responsibilities.
The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the results
of any such inquiry.

The Committee's recommendations

	406.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve the present report and, in particular, the following conclusions:

(a)
The Committee observes the contradiction between the complainants' and
the Government's statements as to the trade union status of the organisers
of the protests which took place in April 1984.   It points out, however,
that the national complainant organisations have stated that they themselves
had organised these protests.

(b)
The Committee emphasises the importance it attaches to the Government
carrying out a thorough and impartial inquiry into the nature of the demonstrations
and the deaths and physical attacks
which occurred during the protest movements
in order to determine responsibilites.
(c)
The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the results
of any such inquiry.

Case No. 1282

COMPLAINT PRESENTED BY THE LOCAL FEDERATION
OF TRADE UNIONS OF CASABLANCA (MOROCCAN
FEDERATION OF LABOUR) AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT
OF MOROCCO

	407.	The Local Federation of Trade Unions of Casablanca, affiliated to
the Moroccan Federation of Labour, submitted a complaint of violations
of freedom of association in Morocco in a communication dated 3 April 1984.
It sent additional information in support of its complaint in a communication
of 9 May 1984.   The Government transmitted its observations on the case
in a letter of 13 May 1985, which reached the ILO when the Committee was
in session.

	408.	Morocco has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection
of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87);  it has ratified the
Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
The complainant's allegations

	409.	The allegations of the complainant refer to the dismissal of 20 workers,
four of whom were trade union and staff delegates whom the complainant
mentions by name, following two strikes in support of workers' claims in
January and February 1984, lasting 48 hours and 24 hours respectively,
and to the hiring of workers to replace the strikers at the Société marocaine
des compteurs Vincent at Mohammedia.

	410.	According to the complainants, following the presentation of a statement
of claims by the workers, the management wished to compel them to work
overtime on Saturday and Sunday.   When the workers refused because they
wished their demands to be met first, the management decreed a reduction
in working time and an increase in the pace of production for certain departments.
According to the complainant, these contradictory measures showed that
the management was willing to resort to all kinds of pressure and diversionary
manoeuvres to impede the workers' legitimate action in support of their
claims.

	411.	The trade union leaders then approached the authorities, and meetings
were held with the delegate from the Ministry of Labour on 30 January 1984,
with the first deputy governor of the town of Mohammedia on 6 February
1984, and with the governor himself on 23 February and 23 April 1984.
These approaches were unsuccessful, since the authorities were unable
to induce the directors of the Société marocaine des compteurs Vincent
to accept the need to reverse their decision on the dismissals and to open
negotiations on the workers' demands.

	412.	The complainant organisation pointed out that the dismissal of trade
union delegates was prohibited by Moroccan law and took exception to the
recruitment of new workers while the strike was in progress.

B.
The Government's reply

	413.	According to the Government the dispute between Compteurs Vincent
and the Local Federation of Trade Unions of Casablanca, affiliated to the
Moroccan Federation of Labour, has been settled thanks to the efforts of
the Casablanca Labour Inspectorate.

	414.	Eight of the dismissed workers, including two trade union delegates,
have been reinstated in their employment.   The remaining workers refused
compensation for their dismissal from the undertaking and lodged an appeal
with the court on 27 November 1984;  however, the management of the undertaking
stated that the dispute in question arose from demands by the staff which
it was unable to satisfy owing to financial difficulties.   The Government
states that it will communicate any decision taken by the court on this
case.

C.
The Committee's conclusions

	415.	The Committee notes that allegations have once again been made concerning
reprisals by an employer against workers involved in a labour dispute.
The Committee recalls that it has already had to examine a number of
cases of this kind concerning Morocco, and even recently in the Compteurs
Vincent undertaking.   [See 230th Report, Case No. 1116 (Morocco), paras.
72 and 78 approved by the Governing Body in November 1983.]

	416.	While noting that the Government has supplied certain information
on the measures taken to reinstate the eight workers as a result of the
intervention of the labour inspectorate, the Committee observes that, as
stated by the Government itself, the other workers dismissed in this case
(12 according to the complainants) lodged appeals with the court on 27
November 1984.

	417.	The Committee recalls that it is often called upon to examine allegations
against the Government of Morocco concerning dismissals on anti-union grounds
and the hiring of workers to replace strikers.   [See in particular 208th
Report, Case No. 1017, paras. 392 to 403;  214th Report, Cases Nos. 992
and 1018, paras. 80 to 92;  230th Report, Case No. 1116, paras. 65 to 84;
and 239th Report, Case No. 1201, paras. 110 to 123.]

	418.	The Committee must therefore once again draw the attention of the
Government to the need for strengthening protection against acts of anti-union
discrimination and must again stress that the current provisions of Moroccan
legislation are inadequate.   It therefore insists on the need to adopt
more specific legal provisions than those that already exist in order to
guarantee workers adequate protection, possibly accompanied by penalties
against employers in the event of discrimination in respect of employment.

	419.	The Committee also wishes to point out that the hiring of workers
to break a strike in a sector like that of Compteurs Vincent, which cannot
be regarded as an essential sector in the strict sense of the term and
hence one in which strikes might be forbidden, constitutes a serious violation
of freedom of association.

	420.	In these circumstances the Committee trusts that the Government will
keep it informed of the outcome of the appeals lodged by the persons concerned.

The Committee's recommendations

	421.	In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve the present report, and in particular the following conclusions:

(a)
the Committee notes with concern that it is often called upon to examine
allegations against the Government of Morocco concerning dismissals on
anti-trade union grounds and the hiring of workers to replace the strikers;

(b)
the Committee once again draws the Government's attention to the need
to strengthen protection against anti-union discrimination, and requests
it to keep the Committee informed of the outcome of the appeals lodged
with the courts by the dismissed workers.

CASES IN WHICH THE COMMITTEE HAS REACHED
INTERIM CONCLUSIONS

Case No. 1054

COMPLAINTS BY THE INTERNATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF FREE TRADE
UNIONS, THE WORLD CONFEDERATION OF LABOUR, THE WORLD FEDERATION
OF TRADE UNIONS, THE DEMOCRATIC CONFEDERATION OF LABOUR AND
OTHER TRADE UNION ORGANISATIONS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF MOROCCO

	422.	The Committee has examined this case on several occasions, the most
recent being at its February 1985 meeting, when it presented an interim
report to the Governing Body [see 238th Report, paras. 205 to 216, approved
by the Governing Body at its 229th Session in February-March 1985].   The
Government subsequently furnished some observations in a communication
dated 30 May 1985, received by the ILO while the Committee was in session.

	423.	Morocco has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection
of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87);  it has ratified the
Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
Previous examination of the case

	424.	The complaints still outstanding in this matter relate to the death
or injury of several hundred persons during demonstrations in connection
with the 24-hour general strike called by the Democratic Confederation
of Labour (CDT) on 20 June 1981 and with the closure of the CDT premises.

	425.	At its session in February-March 1985 the Governing Body approved
the following conclusions drawn up by the Committee:

The Committee observes with regret that the Government has not indicated
whether a judicial inquiry was made into the many deaths that occurred
during the June 1981 demonstrations.   It considers that events of such
gravity should have led the authorities to take effective measures to elucidate
the facts and determine responsibilities.   It again requests the Government
to
indicate whether an inquiry has been carried out and, if so, to communicate
the results thereof.
The Committee recalls the importance it attaches to the protection of trade
union property.   It expresses the hope that the two trade unions affected
by the closure of their
headquarters have now fully recovered the use of
their premises, and requests the Government to supply information in this
regard.

B.
The Government's reply

	426.	In its communication of 30 May 1985, concerning the judicial inquiry
into the events of 20 June 1981, the Government states that it has published
a communiqué setting out detailed information to the effect that the special
courts carried out their duty in accordance with the laws in force in Morocco.

	427.	According to the Government the rights and safeguards of the defence
were respected and sentences were passed according to the criminal nature
of the acts committed by the persons charged.   The persons implicated
in the demonstrations were found guilty and punished.   Those whose involvement
was not proved were released.

	428.	Regarding the allegation in connection with the closure of the premises
of the Democratic Confederation of Labour, the Government states that it
has never ordered the closure of any CDT premises.

	429.	Furthermore the Government states that it has in general used dialogue
and consultation constructively in its relations with the various occupational
organisations and that it has initiated high-level contacts with trade
union representatives to examine various economic and social questions
with them.   It also recalls that the CDT is now represented in Parliament
and is consequently in a position to raise occupational and trade union
issues before the Government, which it can question orally.

	430.	In conclusion, the Government hopes that it can rely on the perception
or sense of fairness of the Committee on Freedom of Association to reinforce
its efforts to settle Case No. 1054 once and for all.

C.
The Committee's conclusions

	431.	The Committee expresses regret that the Government has not supplied
it with the communiqué referred to in its reply of 30 May 1985 which it
states contains detailed information concerning the deaths and injuries
that occurred during the demonstrations of 20 June 1981.   The Committee
requests the Government to communicate this document to it.

	432.	The Committee had already noted the fact that all the trade union
leaders who were involved in this matter were released in November 1983,
following a royal pardon, after more than two years'
imprisonment [see
233rd Report, para. 237].   The Committee also noted that the Democratic
Confederation of Labour is once more taking part in the political and trade
union life of the country and that a number of its representatives have
seats in Parliament.

	433.	The Committee also observes that, according to the Government's reply
of 30 May 1985, it had never ordered the closure of any CDT premises.

	434.	As regards the case as a whole, relating to events that took place
in June 1981 and in view of the fact that two years ago the King pardoned
the trade union leaders who had been involved in the matter, the Committee
notes that the measures taken seem to fit in with the present pattern of
a return to a fully normal situation in the trade union movement since
the CDT is now represented in Parliament and is consequently in a position
to raise occupational matters before the Government, which it can question
orally.

	435.	In these circumstances the Committee trusts that the situation which
arose in connection with Case No. 1054, and which involved death and injuries
during a strike in pursuit of economic and social demands, will not recur.

	436.	The Committee wishes to remind the Government that, in ratifying
Convention No. 98 - and in particular Article 4 thereof - it committed
itself to taking appropriate measures to encourage and promote the full
development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation with
a view to regulating conditions of employment.

	437.	The Committee also reminds the Government of the very great importance
it attaches to the possibility of having recourse to strike action as a
legitimate means of defending the workers' economic and social interests.

	438.	The Committee therefore appeals to the Government to engage in a
dialogue with all the trade union forces in the country, and in particular
with the CDT, so that the Government may henceforth ensure that economic
and social problems are resolved through industrial relations machinery
which is considered reliable by those concerned.

The Committee's recommendations

	439.	In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:

(a)
It regrets that the Government has not supplied it with the communiqué
referred to in its reply of 30 May 1985 containing detailed information
concerning the deaths and injuries that
occurred during the demonstration
of 20 June 1981.   The Committee requests the Government to communicate
this document to it.
(b)
The Committee reminds the Government of the very great importance it
attaches to the possibility of having recourse to strike action as a legitimate
means of defending the workers' economic and social interests and that
henceforth economic and social problems may be resolved through industrial
relations machinery which is considered reliable by those concerned.

(c)
The Committee appeals to the Government to engage in a dialogue with
all the trade union forces in the country, and in particular with the CDT,
in order to ensure that a situation which resulted in death and injury
during a strike called for essentially economic and social reasons in June
1981, will not recur.

Cases Nos. 1129, 1169, 1185 and 1298

COMPLAINTS PRESENTED BY A NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL AND
NATIONAL TRADE UNION ORGANISATIONS AGAINST THE
GOVERNMENT OF NICARAGUA

	440.	The Committee examined Case No. 1129 on two occasions, at its November
l982 and February 1984 meetings, when it presented interim reports to the
Governing Body.  [See 218th Report, paras. 467-481, and 233rd Report, paras.
236-242 and 317, approved by the Governing Body at its 221st and 225th
Sessions in November 1982 and February-March 1984 respectively.]   The
World Confederation of Labour sent additional information in support of
its complaint on 13 April 1984.

	441.	Case No. 1169 has been examined by the Committee on four occasions:
in March 1983, March and June 1984 and March 1985.  [See 222nd, 233rd,
234th and 238th Reports of the Committee, approved by the Governing Body.]

	442.	Case No. 1185 was examined in the Committee's 233rd Report [see paras.
294-307 and 317] approved by the Governing Body at its February-March 1984
session.   The Committee also noted certain information communicated by
the Government in January 1985 [See 238th Report, para. 9, approved by
the Governing Body in February-March 1985].

	443.	Case No. 1298 was examined in February-March 1985 and was the subject
of an interim report approved by the Governing Body.   [238th Report, paras.
232-247.]

	444.	The Government supplied certain information on these cases in communications
of January, May and 29 October 1985.

	445.	Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection
of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

Case No. 1129

	446.	In Case No. 1129, the complainants alleged that as part of a systematic
campaign by the Government to destroy the Central of Nicaraguan Workers
(CTN), the authorities had physically assaulted members of the CTN working
on the state-controlled banana estates and sugar plantations.   The official
militia were said to have threatened the lives of CTN leaders.   In this
connection the complainants stated that Luis Mora, President of the Press
Workers' Union, and Salvador Sánchez, had allegedly been threatened in
this way when they were under detention and that the police had attempted
to make Salvador Sánchez sign a statement against the CTN.   Moreover,
sugar workers belonging to the CTN had allegedly been prevented from entering
their workplace and other members of this union had been allegedly arrested
solely by reason of their membership and their involvement in union activities.

	447.	During a direct contacts mission by a representative of the Director-General
in December 1983, the leaders of the CTN had stated that the physical attacks
by the authorities in state-controlled banana estates and sugar plantations
were continuing.   The Ministry of Labour considered that the complaints
should be more specific, since they did not indicate who made the death
threats, or the date, place and circumstances in which the events supposedly
took place.   According to the Government, the allegations of physical
attacks and denial of entry to work centres were equally vague, as they
gave no names, places or dates.

	448.	At its February-March 1984 session, the Governing Body approved the
following recommendations of the Committee:

	(a)
The Committee requests the Government to take up the suggestion of the
Director-General's representative that the Ministry responsible for agrarian
reform should obtain further information and be informed of the allegations
that members of the CTN have been physically attacked by the
authorities
on state-controlled banana estates and sugar plantations, and that sugar
workers affiliated to the CTN have been prevented from entering their work
centres;  the Committee also requests the complainant to transmit any further
information it may have concerning this matter.
	(b)
The Committee requests the Government to call for an investigation of
the alleged threats by official militias against the lives of trade union
leaders (specifically, Luis
Mora and Salvador Sánchez) and to keep it informed
of its findings."

	449.	Subsequently, in its communication of 13 April 1984, the WCL complained
of the arrest of several members of the CTN, whom it mentioned by name,
and whose names also appear in Cases Nos. 1169 and 1298 which will be examined
in the present working paper, with the exception of Eduardo Alberto Gutiérrez,
Eric González González and Miltón Silva Gaitán.   Moreover, the WCL alleged
that the Ministry of Labour refused to recognise the executive committees
of a number of unions in the agricultural estates of Fátima and Las Mojarras
at El Jicaral (department of León), of the La Concepción agricultural estate
in Matagalpa, and of the Chinandega and Managua service stations, all members
of CTN.

	450.	In its communication of January 1985 the Government explained that
prior to the Revolution, one banana workers' union had covered 16 banana
plantations in the west of the country, and that following the change of
régime this union had freely and voluntarily joined the Sandinista Central
of Workers (CST).   During 1982 the owner of these plantations had embarked
on dealings with the CTN in order to set up a union parallel to the one
already existing.

	451.	According to the Government, the CTN activist in this region was
Pablo José Muñoz Bermúdez, one of the murderers of Dr. Pedro Joaquín Chamorro,
director and owner of the newspaper La Prensa.   This individual used the
pseudonym Juan José Ramos López to disguise his true identity.   With the
support of the owner of the agricultural estates, this CTN activist had
coerced workers into leaving the banana workers' union.   Serious clashes
had taken place between the two groups, and the behaviour of the owner
moreover constituted a violation of the labour laws and the provisions
of Convention No. 98.   Once the true identity of the CTN leader was known,
the workers reacted violently and the authorities had been obliged to intervene
in order to avoid more serious consequences.

	452.	Regarding the obstacles encountered by the CTN leaders in the sugar
industry, the Government states that this union carried on its activities
solely in the Xavier Guerra refinery.   In this factory acts of sabotage,
such as throwing stones and metal rods into the machinery for the obvious
purpose of damaging them, had taken place.   Those responsible had been
dismissed in accordance with the law.   Some of them, moreover, had been
subsequently reinstated in their employment.

	453.	As regards the threats against Mr. Salvador Sánchez, the Government
explained that this individual had been working at the Aldo Chavarría hospital,
and that with the complicity of a physician in this establishment he had
often obtained sick leave for the purpose of devoting all his time to political
activities under the trade union cover of the CTN.   Moreover, he had stolen
medicaments worth several thousand córdobas from the hospital for lucrative
purposes.   When he had been discovered, he had taken refuge in the Venezuelan
Embassy,
alleging political persecution, whereas in reality he had been
accused of an offence under the ordinary law.   He later went to Costa Rica,
where he joined a counter-revolutionary organisation in which he had been
placed in charge of a military force with which he had tried to occupy
the frontier post at El Espino in October 1983.   He had then been captured,
judged in accordance with the law of the land, and was now serving his
sentence.

	454.	As for Luis Mora, the Government stated that during his trial it
had been proved that, during a trip to Costa Rica, he had been recruited
by the ARDE organisation which had given him money and equipment for counter-
revolutionary activities.   Luis Mora had admitted his crimes during a
national television broadcast and had implicated leaders of the CTN.
The Government explained that, as this was his first offence, he had been
pardoned in August 1984.

	455.	Finally, the Government said that offences under ordinary law should
not be used to damage the image of a government by taking advantage of
the cover and the authority afforded by the ILO.

	456.	The Government repeats its earlier statement in its reply of 27 May
l985, but does not reply to the allegation relating to the refusal of the
authorities to register the executive committees of certain trade unions.

Case No. 1169

	457.	The allegations still pending in Case no. 1169 referred to the arrest
of six persons, whose names were listed in Annex I to the Committee's 238th
Report, and of 18 other trade union leaders or members whose names figured
in Annex II to the same Report.   The complainants also alleged that members
of the Trade Union of Dockers, Employees and Office Staff of Corinto Docks
(SEEOMC), in particular Messrs. Danilo Contreras and René Argeñal, respectively
President of the union and Treasurer of its Supervisory Board, had allegedly
been obliged to leave the country because they had been harassed by the
labour and military authorities.

	458.	Regarding the alleged arrests of the six persons mentioned in Annex I,
the Government replied that these were not trade unionists, nor were they
any longer in prison.   It did not, however, indicate the concrete facts
warranting these arrests.

	459.	In connection with the imprisonment of the 18 trade union leaders
or members whose names were listed in Annex II, the Government stated that
it needed additional information in order to be able to reply to these
allegations (workplace and present whereabouts, office held and union to
which they belonged, place and date of the arrest and the grounds for it).

	460.	The Committee accordingly requested the complainants to provide further
details.   It nevertheless pointed out to the
Government that the complainants
had already provided a number of elements of information regarding the
arrests concerned, in particular their date and place, so that the Committee
hoped that the Government would be in a position to reply to these allegations
at an early date.

	461.	Regarding the harassment to which the members of the Trade Union
of Dockers, Employees and Office Staff of Corinto Docks, in particular
Messrs. Contreras and Argeñal, were said to have been subjected, the Government
told the representative of the Director-General during the direct contacts
mission of December 1983 that Mr. Contreras had voluntarily left the country
after having cashed a cheque on 21 February 1983 for 12,740 córdobas, made
out by an undertaking to the order of the SEEOMC.   The cheque should have
been deposited in the union's account as required by Nicaraguan law, but,
with the connivance of a bank employee, Mr. Contreras was able to cash
it.   As to René Argeñal, he left the country after taking 3,000 córdobas
from the SEEOMC's petty cash.

	462.	At its February 1984 session, the Committee noted this information
but requested the Government to send the text of the final decision handed
down in the matter of the alleged embezzlement of SEEOMC funds.

	463.	The Government later said that it would send a copy of the court
decision as soon as it had been given.

	464.	At its February-March 1985 session, the Governing Body adopted the
following recommendations of the Committee:

	Bearing in mind that the Government has not indicated the precise facts
warranting the arrest of six persons (mentioned in Annex I) whose subsequent
release it confirms, the Committee wishes to draw the attention of the
Government to the principle that measures designed to deprive trade union
leaders and members of their freedom constitute a serious risk of interference
in union activities and that, when such measures are taken on trade union
grounds, they constitute an infringement of the principles of freedom of
association.   The Committee requests the Government to indicate the concrete
acts which gave rise to the arrest of these six persons.

	Regarding the imprisonment of 18 trade union leaders and members (mentioned
in Annex II), the Committee notes that the Government states that it needs
additional information in order
to be able to reply (workplace and present
whereabouts, office held and union to which they belong, place and date
of the arrest and grounds for it).   The Committee requests the complainants
to provide as many details about these persons as they can obtain in the
sense indicated by the Government.   The Committee nevertheless wishes
to point out to the Government that the complainants have already provided
a number of elements of information regarding the arrests concerned, in
particular their date and place (see 233rd Report, paras. 255-256) for
which
reason the Committee considers that the Government should be in a
position to reply to these allegations at an early date.
	The Committee notes that the Government will transmit the results of the
embezzlement proceedings affecting the trade union organisation SEEOMC
as soon as the judgement is handed down.

	465.	With its reply of 27 May 1985 the Government sends the judicial decision
in the embezzlement proceedings affecting the Trade Union of Dockers, Employees
and Office Staff of Corinto Docks, handed down by the Court of Appeal of
León (criminal division) on 31 January 1984.   This decision confirms the
sentence of imprisonment by the judge of the court of first instance at
Chinandega pronounced in their absence against Messrs. Argeñal and Contreras,
former President and Treasurer of the union, for theft from the said union,
more precisely for the unlawful appropriation of the sums of 3,000 and
l2,740 córdobas respectively, and for having left the country.

	466.	In this communication the Government also indicates that it is endeavouring
to collect information regarding the grounds for the arrest of the six
persons mentioned in Annex I to the 238th Report, who have been released,
and it repeats its willingness to explain the situation of the 18 other
persons mentioned in Annex II to the 238th Report.

	467.	In a subsequent communication dated 29 October 1985, as regards the
six persons mentioned in Annex I, the Government states that Monico Fuentes
was detained from 16 October 1982 to 7 January 1983 for having distributed
counter-revolutionary tracts supporting what the Government refers to as
a mercenary group (FDN), that Nicólas Gonzáles and Santos Ponce were detained
from August to December 1982 for having delivered mail for the counter-revolutionary
Rafaela Herrera, that Victoriano Ramos Jiménez was detained from 16 October
1982 to December 1983 for having given logistic support to the mercenary
group (FDN), that Santos Larios Cornejo and Saturnino López Centeno were
detained from 17 October 1982 to December 1983 for having recruited persons
for the mercenary group FDN.

	468.	As regards the 18 other detained trade unionists mentioned in Annex II,
the Government states that:  (a) Cresencio Carranza Jarquín and Guillermo
Salmerón Jiménez were detained from April to December 1983 for having participated
in a campaign against the Government;  (b) José Angel Altamirano López
was arrested in April 1983 for having directed a counter-revolutionary
unit and for being found in illegal possession of weapons.   He belonged
to the mercenary group ARDE and was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment
by the courts;  (c) Mercedes Hernández Díaz was arrested in April 1983
for having recruited persons for the mercenary group ARDE and for having
provided financial aid for the purchase of arms.   She was sentenced to
12 years' imprisonment;  (d) Eleázar Marenco was arrested in April 1983
for having participated in several conspiratorial meetings and for having
provided financial aid for the purchase of arms.   He was sentenced to
six years' imprisonment;  (e) Reynaldo Blandón, former
Somosa national
guardsman, was detained from 27 March to 12 September 1980;  (f) Erik Luna
was detained from 11 to 17 May 1983 for having known of the activities
of counter-revolutionary elements linked to the ARDE;  (g) José Angel Peñalosa
was also detained from 11 to 17 May 1983 for his logistic support of the
mercenary group ARDE;  and (h) Fidel López Martínez was detained from December
1982 to January 1983 for separatist propaganda activities.   The Government
states that it will soon send information on the remaining cases.

Case No. 1185

	469.	The allegations pending in Case No. 1185 referred to the arrest of
Abelino González País on 2 February 1983 in El Pijao district, north of
Matagalpa, simply for being a member of the Central of Nicaraguan Workers
(CTN);  he was allegedly being held without charge at the central command
post of Matagalpa.

	470.	The complainants also alleged persecution, harassment, interrogation
and threats by State Security agents against Hermógenes Aguirre Largaespada,
an official of the Union of Employees and Manual Workers of Andes and Induquinisa
(STAI) affiliated to the CTN, and Larry Lee Shoures, President of this
union.   The former had been interrogated about the activities of his union
on ten occasions and had been pressed to become an informer for the State
Security forces.   Moreover, on 24 April 1983, a member of the Sandinista
People's Army was said to have fired four shots at his house and insulted
him and his family.   The following day, 20 people went to the homes of
Messrs. Aguirre and Larry Lee Shoures, threatening to kill them and to
set fire to their houses for being affiliated to the CTN and therefore
counter-revolutionaries.

	471.	At its February 1985 session, the Committee noted, in paragraph 9
of its 238th Report, the Government's statement in its communication of
January 1985 that these persons were not detained and its request for further
information on them to facilitate inquiries.   The Committee recalled that
detailed allegations could be found in paragraph 295 of its 233rd Report
and requested the Government to send a clear and precise reply on these
allegations and on the situation of these trade unionists.

	472.	In its communication of 27 May 1985, the Government stresses its
intention to transmit to the Committee on Freedom of Association at a later
date any information which it might obtain on the situation of Messrs.
Hermógenes Aguirre Largaespada and Larry Lee Shoures, and on that of Mr.
Abelino González País, and again confirms that the names of the persons
concerned do not appear in the prison records.

Case No. 1298

	473.	The allegations pending in the present case referred to the occupation
of the headquarters of the Confederation of Trade Union
Unity (CUS) on
two occasions, once by a group of 20 persons on 18 August 1984 and a second
time after groups of persons had broken in on 25 August 1984.

	474.	The Government considered that these incidents were the result of
divided opinions within the CUS as to whether it should remain within or
withdraw from an opposition political group.

	475.	In the complainants' view, on the other hand, the incidents were
caused by the interference of public officials with a view to obtaining
the CUS's withdrawal from this opposition movement.

	476.	The complainants also sent in support of their complaint a statement
by a legal adviser to the CUS, sworn before a notary, in which he states
that he was subjected to threats and pressure in order to induce him to
commit acts that would be instrumental in doing away with the CUS.   The
person concerned stated that an official of the Ministry of the Interior
had ordered him to seek out persons belonging to the CUS to support a group
of persons not belonging to this organisation which had occupied its headquarters.
He had been forced to go to the CUS on 25 August to support the occupants,
and had there met members and non-members of the CUS.   A general assembly
had then been held at the CUS headquarters and, when the parties failed
to reach an agreement, several persons had injured or harangued the true
members of the CUS and partially destroyed its office.

	477.	The complainants also stated that the police had done nothing to
stop the attack on the CUS headquarters by certain groups on 25 August.

	478.	At its February-March 1985 session the Governing Body approved the
following recommendations of the Committee:

	(a)
With respect to the occupation of the CUS headquarters on two occasions,
and in order to be able to pronounce on this matter in full knowledge of
the facts, the Committee requests the Government to send specific observations
on the complainants' allegations that the occupation of the CUS premises
on successive occasions resulted from interference by public officials
(in particular, on the link between the State Security forces and the two
persons who carried out the first occupation, and the notarised statements
of the former legal adviser to the CUS concerning interference by
the authorities
in the two occupations of the CUS headquarters).
	(b)
The Committee requests the Government to reply to the allegation that
the police, in spite of being in the vicinity of the CUS headquarters on
25 August 1984 (the day on which the violent events mentioned in the complaint
occurred) did nothing to avoid the attack by certain groups, intervening
only when everything was over.
	(c)
The Committee would point out that the climate of violence which forms
the background to some of the allegations can only impede the free exercise
of trade union rights.

	(d)
The Committee requests the Government to reply to the allegation concerning
the arrest of José Agustín Téllez, Secretary-General of the Federation
of Peasant Workers in Carazo (FETRACAMCA)."

	479.	In its communication of 27 May 1985, the Government gives information
on the judicial dissolution of the Union of Workers in Agricultural Enterprises
of Masaya by court decision of 13 June 1984.   It also indicates that two
new unions have applied for registration with the directorate of trade
union organisations and that the latter is examining the applications.
It does not reply to the allegations pending in the present case regarding
the occupation of the CUS headquarters and the arrest of the Secretary-General
of the Federation of Peasant Workers in Carazo.

The Committee's conclusions

	480.	In general, the Committee observes that the Government has supplied
detailed replies on certain aspects of the present cases, but regrets that
it has not replied to all the allegations.

	481.	Regarding Case No. 1129, the Committee notes the detailed replies
furnished by the Government regarding both the difficulties encountered
by the officials of unions affiliated to CTN in conducting their union
activities in plantations and in the sugar industry, and on the situation
of Messrs. Luis Mora and Salvador Sánchez.

	482.	In connection with the former point, the Committee notes that, according
to the Government, the assaults on an official of the CTN were not attributable
to the authorities and that the dismissals that had taken place in the
only refinery in which the CTN was represented were due to acts of sabotage.
The Committee also has to note that, despite the request for additional
information on this aspect of the case addressed to them in February 1984,
the complainants have supplied no details in support of their allegations.

	483.	As regards Messrs. Luis Mora and Salvador Sánchez, it would appear
from the Government's observations that the former has been pardoned and
the latter sentenced for activities unconnected with freedom of association.

	484.	The Committee nevertheless notes with regret that the Government
has still not replied to the most recent allegations of the WCL concerning
the imprisonment of Eric González González, Miltón Silva Gaitán and Eduardo
Alberto Gutiérrez, members of the CTN, and the refusal to register the
executive committees of unions on the
agricultural estates of Fátima and
Las Mojarras in El Jicaral (department of León), the agricultural estate
of La Concepción in Matagalpa and the Chinandega and Managua service stations,
despite the fact that, according to the Government's reply on Case No.
1298, two new unions have been registered, of which it gives no further
details.   The Committee requests the Government to send replies on these
various points.

	485.	With respect to Case No. 1169, the Committee notes the decision of
the Court of Appeal of León (criminal division) of 31 January 1984 confirming
the sentences of imprisonment pronounced in their absence against Messrs.
Contreras and Argeñal, former President and Treasurer of the Supervisory
Board of the Trade Union of Dockers, Employees and Office Staff of Corinto
Docks, respectively convicted of having unlawfully appropriated the sums
of 12,740 and 3,000 córdobas belonging to the union and of having fled
the country.

	486.	As regards the six persons mentioned in Annex I of the 238th Report,
the Committee notes the information provided by the Government from which
it appears that these persons were arrested in 1982 and released in 1983
for having distributed counter-revolutionary tracts or for having given
logistic support to counter-revolutionary activities.

	487.	As regards the 18 trade unionists mentioned in Annex II of the 238th
Report, the Committee notes that the Government supplies information on
nine of them from which it appears that three were sentenced to imprisonment
for having directed counter-revolutionary activities or for possession
or purchase of arms.   The six other persons on whom the Government supplies
information were released after being detained for counter-revolutionary
activities.   The Committee requests the Government to supply copies of
the judgements handed down against these three persons and to indicate
whether the nine other trade unionists mentioned by the complainants, namely
Rito Rivas Amador, Iván Blandón, Víctor Ríos, Napoleón Aragón, Juan Ramón
Duarte and his brother, Maximino Flores Obando, Anastasio Jiménez Maldonado
and Gabriel Jiménez Maldonado are still in prison and, if so, to supply
details on the specific reasons for their continued detention.

	488.	With respect to Case No. 1185 the Committee notes the Government's
assurances that the names of Abelino González País, Hermógenes Aguirre
Largaespada and Larry Lee Shoures do not appear on the prison records.

	489.	Nevertheless, bearing in mind that the two last-mentioned persons
are alleged to have been subjected to reprisals and violence for having
belonged to a trade union affiliated to the CTN, the Committee must firmly
recall the importance it attaches to the conduct of trade union activities
in full freedom.   It therefore urges the Government to make every effort
to guarantee a climate favourable to the development of the various peaceful
tendencies of the trade union movement in Nicaragua.

	490.	Regarding Case No. 1298 the Committee notes with regret that the
Government has not replied to the allegations still pending.

	491.	It repeats its earlier request for an explanation of the occupation
of the CUS headquarters on 18 August 1984, led by two persons alleged to
have links with the State Security forces, as evidenced by the notarised
statement of the former legal adviser to the CUS.

	492.	It also again requests the Government to reply to the allegation
that on the occasion of the second occupation of the CUS headquarters on
25 August 1984, the police did nothing to stop the attack and intervened
only when everything was over, although they were in the vicinity of the
organisation's headquarters.

	493.	Finally, it again requests the Government to indicate whether José
Agustín Téllez, Secretary-General of the Federation of Peasant Workers
in Carazo, is in prison and if so, to indicate the grounds for his detention.

The Committee's recommendations

	494.	In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve the present interim report, and in particular the following
conclusions:

Generally speaking, the Committee observes that, during its session in
May 1985, the Government supplied detailed replies on certain aspects of
the present cases, but regrets that it has not replied to all the allegations.
The Committee also deplores that the latest information supplied by the
Government concerning the detention of trade unionists was only received
by the Committee during its present meeting.

(a)
In Case No. 1129 the Committee notes that Mr. Mora has been pardoned
and that Mr. Sánchez has been sentenced for activities unconnected with
freedom of association.

(b)
The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the
allegations to which it has not replied regarding the imprisonment of three
trade unionists mentioned by the complainants, the names of which are annexed
to the present report, and on the refusal to register the executive committees
of the agricultural unions of Fátima and Las Mojarras in El Jicaral (department
of León) and of La Concepción in Matagalpa, and of the unions of service
station workers in Chinandega and Managua.

(c)
In Case No. 1169 the Committee notes that of the 18 trade unionists
mentioned by the complainants, six have been released and three have received
prison sentences.   It requests the
Government to supply copies of the
judgements handed down against these three persons and to indicate whether
the nine other trade unionists cited in the Annex are still in prison and,
if so, to state the reasons for their detention.

(d)
In Case No. 1185 the Committee considers that, bearing in mind the allegations
that trade union officials have been subjected to reprisals and violence
for having belonged to a union affiliated to the CTN, it must recall the
importance which it attaches to the exercise of trade union activities
in full freedom.   It therefore urges the Government to make efforts to
guarantee a climate favourable to the peaceful development of the different
tendencies of the trade union movement in Nicaragua.

(e)
In Case No. 1298 the Committee notes with regret that the Government
has not replied to the allegations still pending.

(f)
The Committee repeats its earlier request for an explanation of the
occupation of the CUS headquarters on 18 August 1984, led by two persons
alleged to have links with the State Security forces, as evidenced by the
statement made by the former legal adviser to the CUS.

(g)
The Committee again requests the Government to reply to the allegation
that, during the second occupation of the CUS headquarters on 25 August
l984, the police did nothing to stop the attack and intervened only when
everything was over, although they were in the vicinity of the organisation's
headquarters.

(h)
The Committee again requests the Government to indicate whether José
Agustín Téllez, Secretary-General of the Federation of Peasant Workers
in Carazo, is in prison and if so, to indicate the grounds for his detention.

COMPLAINTS PRESENTED BY THE PERMANENT CONGRESS
OF TRADE UNION UNITY OF LATIN AMERICAN WORKERS,
THE AUTONOMOUS TRADE UNION FEDERATION OF GUATEMALA,
THE INTERNATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF FREE TRADE UNIONS,
THE WORLD FEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS AND THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE OF
TRADE UNION UNITY AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF GUATEMALA

	495.	The Committee examined Cases Nos. 1176, 1195 and 1215 at its November
1984 and May 1985 meetings and on both occasions submitted an interim report
to the Governing Body [see 236th Report, paras. 401-525, and 239th Report,
paras. 210-225, approved by the Governing Body at its 228th Session (November
1984) and 230th Session (May-June 1985), respectively].   The Committee
also examined Case No. 1195 at an earlier meeting [see 230th Report, paras. 689-699,
approved by the Governing Body at its 224th Session (November 1983)].

	496.	At its meeting in February 1985, the Committee examined Case No. 1262
and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see 238th Report,
paras. 269-281, approved by the Governing Body at its 229th Session (February-March

	497.	Subsequently, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
(ICFTU) and the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) submitted new allegations
in connection with Case No. 1195 in communications dated 13 June and 24 July
1985, respectively.   The Autonomous Trade Union Federation of Guatemalteca
(FASGUA) presented
further allegations in connection with Case No. 1215
in a communication dated 4 September 1985.

	498.	The Government sent a certain number of observations in two communications
dated 28 August 1985.

	499.	Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection
of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
Previous examination of the cases

	500.	When the Committee examined Cases Nos. 1176, 1195 and 1215 at its
meeting in May 1985, it made the following recommendations regarding the
allegations still pending [see 239th Report, para. 225]:

(a)
The Committee expresses its deep concern at the serious nature of the
situation which is characterised by the detention, kidnapping, assault
or assassination of trade union leaders and other persons connected with
the trade union movement, all the more so since some of the allegations
date from January 1983 and the whereabouts of the abducted persons remain
unknown.
(b)
The Committee urges the Government to do its utmost to ensure that the
investigations under way - which should be conducted by the judiciary -
result in the whereabouts of those who have disappeared being clarified
(Julián Revolorio, Raimundo Pérez, Yolanda Urízar, Manuel Francisco Contreras,
José Luis Ramos, Luis Estrada, Víctor Ascón, Lucrecia Orellana, Gracida
Samayoa and her two children and  Antonia Argüeta), the facts being elucidated
in full, responsibilities being determined and the guilty parties being
punished.   The Committee requests the Government to inform it of developments
on this point.
(c)
The Committee draws the Government's attention to the principle that
freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental
human rights, and in particular those relating to the inviolability of
human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed.
(d)
The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the
allegations contained in FASGUA's communications of 10 October 1984 (the
closing down of operations at the Universal Textiles Factory with a view
to destroying the union and the kidnapping of the brother of the trade
unionist Valerio Oscal) and 12 February 1985 (assault on, and kidnapping
of, Mr. Sergio Vinicio Samayoa Morales), as well as on those contained
in the
communications from the ICFTU and ORIT dated 10 May 1985 (abduction
of the trade union leader Felicita Floridalma Lucero).

c	501.	With respect to Case No. 1262, the Committee made the following recommendations
concerning the allegations still pending at its meeting in February 1985
[see 238th Report, para. 281]:

(a)
The Committee expresses its deep concern at the serious nature of the
allegations which refer, in particular, to many cases of kidnapping and
disappearance or attempted kidnapping, as well as the serious physical
assault of trade union leaders or trade unionists, and deplores the fact
that the Government has not sent detailed information in this respect except
as regards one person mentioned by the complainants.
(b)
As regards the attempted kidnapping of the trade union leader Alvaro
René Sosa and the physical assault of which he was the victim, the Committee
urges the Government to carry out a judicial inquiry with a view to elucidating
the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty
parties.   The Committee requests the Government to supply information
on any such inquiry and on its outcome.
(c)
As regards the kidnapping and disappearance or attempted kidnapping
of the other trade union leaders or trade unionists mentioned by the complainants
(in one case the allegation concerns the kidnapping of the brother of a
trade union leader who had escaped various attempts at capture), the Committee
urgently requests the Government to carry out the necessary investigations
to determine the whereabouts of the persons who have allegedly disappeared
and to initiate a judicial inquiry with a view to elucidating the facts
in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties
for the kidnappings or attempted kidnappings.   The Committee requests
the Government to supply information on any such inquiry and on its outcome.
(d)
In general, the Committee draws to the Government's attention the principle
that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which
fundamental human rights, and in particular those relating to human life
and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed.

B.
New allegations

	502.	In a communication dated 13 June 1985, the ICFTU refers to a mission
which it sent from 27 January to 9 February 1985 to Central America, where
among other countries it visited Guatemala.   According
to information
received by the mission, Guatemala is living in a state of insecurity because
of the persistent policy of intimidation and terror employed against the
population, while the practice of arrest and disappearance has become a
standard and systematic instrument of repression from which an alarming
number of victims have suffered, especially trade union leaders both in
the towns and in the country.

	503.	The ICFTU adds that the mission drew up a list of cases of arrest
and disappearance, assassinations and attacks on trade union leaders and
activists;   97 instances of arrest and disappearance and 37 assassinations
were cited between 1980 and May 1985.   The list of trade union leaders
and members who have disappeared or been kidnapped, assassinated or physically
attacked appears in an annex to this report.   [This list does not include
persons already cited in other cases brought before the Committee on Freedom
of Association.]

	504.	In its communication dated 24 July 1985, the WFTU refers to the kidnapping
of trade union leader Felicita Floridalma Lucero, an allegation that was
previously brought before the Committee in connection with Case No. 1195.

	505.	In its communication dated 4 September 1985, FASGUA alleges that
on 1 September 1985 the body was discovered of Eleazar Esaú Barrera Martínez,
an employee of the textile factory Fábrica de Tejidos Imperial who had
been kidnapped during mass demonstrations against the increase in prices
and in support of wage claims.   According to FASGUA, his body was found
hanging by the neck from an electric wire and bore signs of torture.

	506.	FASGUA adds that on the morning of 4 September 1985 nurse Rita Josefina
Pineda Aldana was kidnapped by armed men.

	507.	Finally, FASGUA alleges that on 3 September 1985, 500 members of
the National Army supported by 12 artillery trucks and about 20 tanks launched
an attack on the University of San Carlos and searched every building,
including the headquarters of the University Workers' Union where they
caused extensive damage and seized trade union documents.

C.
The Government's reply

	508.	The Government states in its communications dated 28 August 1985
that all the complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association
communicated to it by the ILO have been passed on to the Ministry of the
Interior with instructions to transmit to the Committee on Freedom of Association
any information that may come to light as a result of its inquiries.

	509.	The Government adds that a copy of the statement it received to the
effect that Floridalma Lucero y Lucero and Amancio Samuel
Villatoro had
disappeared has been communicated to the competent tribunal and that investigations
are being conducted to determine their whereabouts.   With respect to the
disappearance of Julián Revolorio, Raymundo Pérez, Yolanda Urizar Martínez
de Aguilar, Manuel Francisco Contreras, José Luis Ramos, Luis Estrada,
Victor Ascón, Lucrecia Orellana, Graciela Samayoa and her children, Fermín
Solano, Antonio Argüeta and Sergio Venicio Samayoa Morales, the Government
states that none of the persons cited are being held in any of the country's
detention centres but that inquiries are being made into their whereabouts.
The Government indicates that, in the case of investigations of this
nature, the judiciary is duly informed by the General Directorate of the
National Police through the competent tribunal.

	510.	The Government states further that it has collaborated closely with
the judiciary and the Supreme Court of Justice in the investigations into
disappearances and in the habeas corpus proceedings.   The Head of State
has accordingly set up a committee consisting of representatives of the
Ministry of National Defence, the State Prosecutor's Office and the Ministry
of the Interior to determine the whereabouts of the persons listed as having
disappeared;  in its efforts to arrive at the truth, the Committee has
conducted an investigation throughout the country, issued the necessary
orders to all state security forces and invited the civilian authorities
to collaborate.   It appears from the investigations that the persons whose
names appear on the list submitted by the Mutual Support Group to the committee
are not being held in any penal or preventive detention centre in the country.

	511.	The Government goes on to state that the investigations must be considered
as being still under way since, inter alia, it has not yet been possible
to obtain the list of Guatemalan citizens who have emigrated to Mexico
in order to determine whether some of the persons who have disappeared
are listed as official residents of that country.   The Government indicates
that, at the request of the interested parties and in accordance with the
law, the State Prosecutor's Office has initiated penal proceedings with
the Court of First Instance and with the Justices of the Peace of the Penal
Branch of the Departments of Petén, Quetzaltenango, Zacapa and Guatemala
City in connection with alleged kidnappings and has taken part in proceedings
already initiated.   The Government states that in the course of the investigations
conducted in the various departments of the Republic, no allegations were
made regarding the existence of detention centres other than the legally
constituted penal centres for preventive detention and for the serving
of prison sentences.

	512.	The Government declares that the committee has conducted a thorough
official investigation at the national level, employing all possible means
at its disposal, and that its report constitutes the most thorough investigation
of the problem of "disappeared persons" that the present Government has
carried out in its efforts to establish the facts.

	513.	Finally, with respect to the alleged closing down of operations at
the Universal Textiles Factory, the Government states that the General
Labour Inspectorate and the General Labour Directorate collaborated fully
with the workers who had lodged a petition against its closure.   According
to the Government, the workers and the undertaking reached an agreement
which included the payment of compensation.   The only point on which agreement
was not reached, despite the efforts of the General Labour Inspectorate,
concerned five trade union leaders.   Charges were accordingly brought
against the undertaking in June 1985 with the competent labour tribunal
which has not yet handed down its ruling.

D.
The Committee's conclusions

	514.	The Committee notes the Government's statement that the Head of State
has set up a committee consisting of representatives of the Ministry of
National Defence, the State Prosecutor's Office and the Ministry of the
Interior to determine the whereabouts of the persons listed as having disappeared
and that the Committee has conducted a nation-wide investigation with the
collaboration of the civilian and military authorities.   The Committee
also notes that, according to the Government, the persons listed as having
disappeared are not being held in any penal or preventive detention centre.

	515.	The Committee notes that, according to the Government, inquiries
have been made into the whereabouts of trade union leaders Felicita Floridalma
Lucero y Lucero, Amancio Samuel Villatorio and Sergio Vinicio Samayoa Morales.
The Committee also notes the Government's statement that it has not yet
been possible to establish the whereabouts of other kidnapped trade union
leaders and members (Julián Revolorio, Raimundo Pérez, Yolanda Urízar,
Manuel Francisco Contreras, José Luis Ramos, Luis Estrada, Víctor Ascón,
Lucrecia Orellana, Graciela Samayoa and her two children, Fermín Solano
and Antonia Argüeta).   The Committee regrets that the Government has not
supplied any details on the other 31 trade union leaders and members who
have disappeared or on the alleged assassination of 13 trade union leaders
and members and physical attacks on another union leader.   The Committee
further recalls that it had requested the Government to conduct a judicial
inquiry into the attempted kidnapping and physical attacks on former trade
union leader Alvaro René Sosa.

	516.	In these circumstances, the Committee recalls in general terms that
when a climate of violence prevails in a country, this renders the exercise
of trade union rights practically impossible and also recalls, as did the
International Labour Conference in its 1970 Resolution concerning trade
union rights and their relation to civil liberties, that the absence of
civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights
and that the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organisations
must be based on respect for those civil liberties.   It expresses its
profound concern at the
seriousness of a situation in which a large number
of trade union leaders and members have been assassinated or have disappeared,
particularly since some of the allegations date back several years and
there is no sign of any improvement in the situation or of the facts being
elucidated.

	517.	The Committee urges the Government once again to do its utmost to
ensure that the investigations under way result in the establishment of
the whereabouts of the trade union leaders and members listed in the annex
to this report as having disappeared.   The Committee requests the Government
to ensure that these investigations cover all the trade unionists listed
as having disappeared who have been cited by the complainants and to inform
it of the outcome.

	518.	With respect to the trade union leaders and members who have been
assassinated or have suffered serious physical harm, the Committee notes
that inquiries are being carried out by the administrative authorities.
It urges the Government to carry out judicial inquiries in order to elucidate
the facts in full, determine responsibilities and punish the guilty parties.
The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome.

	519.	With respect to the alleged closing down of operations at the Universal
Textiles Factory in order to destroy the trade union, the Committee observes
that the Government does not refer specifically in its statement to the
alleged anti-union nature of the closure of the factory.   The Committee
therefore requests the Government to indicate the grounds for closing down
operations at the factory.

	520.	Lastly, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied
to the alleged attack on the headquarters of the San Carlos University
Workers' Union by National Army troops, and the serious damage caused and
the seizing of trade union documents.   The Committee requests the Government
to send its observations on the matter.

The Committee's recommendations

	521.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following
conclusions:

(a)
The Committee recalls in general terms that when a climate of violence
prevails in a country, this renders the exercise of trade union rights
practically impossible and also recalls that the absence of civil liberties
removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights, and that the
rights conferred on workers' and employers' organisations must be based
on respect for those civil liberties.

(b)
The Committee expresses its profound concern at the seriousness of a
situation in which a large number of trade union leaders and members have
been assassinated or have disappeared, particularly since some of the allegations
date back several years and there is no sign of any improvement in the
situation or of the facts being elucidated.

(c)
The Committee urges the Government once again to do its utmost to ensure
that the investigations under way result in the establishment of the whereabouts
of the trade union leaders and members listed in the annex to this report
as having disappeared.   The Committee requests the Government to ensure
that these investigations cover all the trade unionists listed as having
disappeared who have been cited by the complainants and to inform it of
the outcome.

(d)
With respect to the trade union leaders and members who have been assassinated
or have suffered serious physical harm, the Committee notes that inquiries
are being carried out by the administrative authorities.   It urges the
Government to carry out judicial inquiries in order to elucidate the facts
in full, determine responsibilities and punish the guilty parties.   The
Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome.

(e)
With respect to the alleged closing down of operations at the Universal
Textiles Factory in order to destroy the trade union, the Committee requests
the Government to indicate the grounds for closing down operations at the
factory.

(f)
Lastly, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to
the alleged attack on the headquarters of the San Carlos University Workers'
Union by National Army troops, and the serious damage caused and the seizing
of trade union documents.   The Committee requests the Government to send
its observations on the matter.

Cases Nos. 1204, 1275, 1301, 1328 and 1341

COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF PARAGUAY PRESENTED BY
THE INTERNATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF FREE TRADE UNIONS,
THE LATIN AMERICAN CENTRAL OF WORKERS AND
THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF PLANTATION,
AGRICULTURAL AND ALLIED WORKERS

	522.	The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions presented the
complaints corresponding to Cases Nos. 1204 (communications dated 20 and
27 May and 13 and 16 October 1983), 1275 (communication dated 17 April
1984), 1301 (communications dated 6 and 25 September 1984), and 1341 (communication
dated 24 June 1985).   The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) presented
the complaint corresponding to Case No. 1328 in a communication dated 6 April
1985.

	523.	Having received certain observations from the Government, the Committee
examined Cases Nos. 1204 and 1275 at its meeting in November 1984, and
submitted interim reports to the Governing Body [see 236th Report of the
Committee, paras. 426 to 443  and 444 to 458, approved by the Governing
Body at its 238th Session (November 1984)].

	524.	The Government representative at the 71st Session of the International
Labour Conference (June 1985) subsequently handed in a number of documents
containing certain information relating to Cases Nos. 1204, 1275 and 1301.

	525.	At the 71st Session (Geneva, 1985) of the International Labour Conference,
the Government representative of Paraguay informed the Committee on the
Application of Standards that his Government had requested a direct contacts
mission to deal specifically with the application of Conventions Nos. 87
and 98 (both ratified by Paraguay).

	526.	Following the discussion of the case of Paraguay in the Committee
on the Application of Standards, the Government presented a communication
dated 20 June 1985 to the Office, expressly requesting that the forthcoming
direct contacts mission would also examine the cases pending before the
Committee on Freedom of Association.

	527.	The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. von Potobsky, a former
official of the ILO, as his representative to carry out this mission, which
took place from 23 to 27 September 1985 in Asunción, and which also included
a visit to Buenos Aires on 21 September for the purpose of contacting and
discussing with the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in Exile (CPTE).
The representative of the Director-General was accompanied on the mission
by Mr. Alberto Odero, a member of the Freedom of Association Branch of
the Department of International Labour Standards, and Mr. Luis Zamudio,
Regional Adviser on Standards.   The report on the mission is attached.

	528.	Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of
the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) and the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

*
*   *

	529.	Following the mission, the International Confederation of Free Trade
Unions (ICFTU) and the International Federation of Plantation, Agricultural
and Allied Workers (IFPAAW), in communications dated respectively 2 and
3 October 1985, presented new allegations in connection with Case No. 1341.
These organisations alleged in their communications that Marcelino Corazón
Medina, chairman of the Co-ordination Committee of Agricultural Producers,
has been detained for over ten days, having been arbitrarily imprisoned
in the police station in Asunción, where he is being subjected to physical
and psychological torture and deprived of visiting rights.   He is now
on a hunger strike and, since he is in a fragile state of health, it is
feared that his life is in danger.   In a communication dated 15 October
l985, the ICFTU states that Mr. Corazón Medina has been transferred, in
a serious condition, to the prison hospital.   In addition, it alleges
that for about 30 days the Government has arbitrarily imprisoned Sebastián
Rodríguez (Secretary General of the Drivers' Trade Union of "Asunción-Fernando
de la Mora" Line 21) for the sole reason of having organised a musical
festival to raise funds for his unemployed colleagues.   The Government
sent certain information in a communication dated 30 October 1985 in which
it states, in particular, that Mr. Marcelino Corazón Medina has been released.

*
*   *

	530.	The Committee would first like to thank Mr. Geraldo von Potobsky
for having accepted to carry out the direct-contacts mission, and for his
detailed report on the cases under consideration, which has enabled the
Committee to examine them.   The Committee considers that the report of
the representative of the Director-General demonstrates the usefulness
of missions of this kind in clarifying the issues raised in the allegations
of the complainant organisations.

	531.	Since the contents of the allegations and the information supplied
by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the representative
of the Director-General during the mission, are covered in the report on
the mission, the Committee may proceed directly with its conclusions on
each case.

A.
General conclusions

	532.	The Committee takes note of the report of the representative of the
Director-General on the mission carried out from 23 to 27 September 1985
in Paraguay.   The Committee also notes that, as the report on the mission
states, the representative of the Director-General was provided with every
facility by the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to enable
him to carry out the mission.   The Committee observes in this respect
that information was obtained during the mission on all of the cases under
consideration.   It regrets, however, that it was not possible to arrange
an interview between the representative of the Director-General and the
Minister of the Interior or a high official of that ministry, in connection
with certain specific allegations falling within its sphere of competence
which were made in the context of Cases Nos. 1204 and 1341.

B.
Conclusions on Case No. 1204

	533.	Regarding the allegations as to detentions, the Committee observes
that all of the persons concerned (nine) have been released.   The Committee
regrets that the Government has failed to state the specific reasons for
the detention of these persons, except in the case of Mr. Aldo Zuccolillo
(detained for systematically and crudely harassing the Government in the
publication "ABC Color") and of Mr. Jorge Alvarenga (a doctor detained
for acts unrelated to trade unionism, according to the information supplied
by the Government).   The Committee also observes that the Government denies
in every case, either explicitly or implicitly, that the detentions were
connected with trade union activities.   In these circumstances, in view
of the lack of information in most cases on the specific reasons for the
detentions, and given the time which has elapsed since the allegations
were presented (May and October 1983), and the fact that all of the persons
concerned have been released, the Committee draws attention in general
terms to the principle that the arrest or detention of trade union leaders
and trade unionists for activities connected with the exercise of trade
union rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association [see,
for example, 218th Report, Case No. 1129 (Nicaragua), para. 477].

	534.	As regards the difficulties encountered by the Union of Journalists
of Paraguay (SPP) for several years in its attempts to obtain legal personality,
the Committee observes that in 1983 the Labour Directorate notified the
trade union that it could not be set up because of defects of substance
such as the existence of another association for the same purposes.   The
Committee also notes that there seems to have been a shift in the Government's
position since then, since while it states that the SPP has not taken any
steps since 1979 for its establishment, it affirms expressly that, from
the legal standpoint, there is no reason why it should not be set up.
While
the Committee regrets that the present secretary-general of the
SPP did not attend the appointment arranged with the representative of
the Director-General, it hopes that the Union of Journalists of Paraguay
will apply for and be granted legal personality in the near future.   In
addition, the Committee recalls that the existence of an organisation in
a determined occupation should not constitute an obstacle to the establishment
of another organisation, if the workers so wish.

	535.	As regards the allegation of dismissal of workers from the "América
Textil" undertaking, the Committee observes that there is a discrepancy
between the contents of the allegations and the Government's statements.
While both agree that dismissals occurred in this undertaking, the complainant
organisation alleged that they had taken place after the presentation of
requests in the trade unions' list of claims.   The Government, however,
stated that the dismissals (affecting 27 workers) had taken place a month
before the trade union had applied to the authorities for recognition.
The Committee regrets that the América Textil undertaking has refused
to meet with the representative of the Director-General of the ILO and
that it has not been possible to obtain information which would clarify
the facts.   In these circumstances, in view of the lack of sufficient
information and given the proximity in time between the dismissals and
the steps taken to set up a trade union in the undertaking concerned (a
trade union which was not recognised because it failed to attain the number
of members required by legislation, owing to the dismissals which took
place), the Committee merely draws attention to the principle that no worker
should be dismissed or subjected to other acts of discrimination in employment
for carrying out trade union activities.

	536.	Finally, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, there
is no undertaking called "FRISA S.A." and that Radio Ñanduti was closed
down not for the reasons given by the complainant organisation, but for
political reasons.

C.
Conclusions on Case No. 1275

	537.	The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the Labour
Appeals Court, by decision of 27 December 1984, decided in favour of the
claims of the Union of Employees of the Bank of Brazil on the matters in
dispute regarding the renewal of the collective agreement.

	538.	As regards the dismissal of trade unionists Duarte, Virgili and Cáceres,
the Committee notes the information provided in the report of the representative
of the Director-General.   In view of the fact that this case is pending
judgement in court, the Committee adjourns examination of this matter until
judgement is pronounced and
requests the Government to transmit a copy
of the judgement as soon as it is handed down.

D.
Conclusions on Case No. 1301

	539.	The Committee observes that in this case the complainant organisation
has alleged that, between 18 August and 10 September 1984, Melanio Morel,
Gregorio Ojeda, Pedro Zárate, Carlos Castillo and Nicasio Guzmán, all of
whom are trade union leaders or trade unionists belonging to the National
Union of Construction Workers (SINATRAC) were detained while setting up
a trade union in the ACEPAR iron and steel plant.   The Committee also
observes that three of these persons met with the representative of the
Director-General and stated the following:  (1) they had intended to set
up a works committee in the undertaking which was building the ACEPAR plant;
(2) on 18 August 1984, as they were preparing for an assembly which they
had called at the bus stop near the ACEPAR plant, and after they had been
warned by the police that they should not hold the assembly, they were
detained by members of the armed forces;  and (3) they had not been brought
to trial.

	540.	The Committee notes that, according to the authorities of the Ministry
of Justice and Labour with whom the representative of the Director-General
met, ACEPAR is a semi-public undertaking located in the military zone and
run by military personnel.   Moreover, according to the ministry authorities,
the assembly which had been called was unauthorised and therefore could
not be held.   The organisers of the assembly had consequently been detained
by the armed forces.   They were later released without having been brought
to trial.

	541.	Although the Committee considers the fact that the legislation of
a country, in order to prevent disruption of the public order, requires
administrative authorisation for the organisation of meetings in public
places does not run counter to the principles of freedom of association,
it wishes to draw attention to the fact that given the absence of criminal
acts in the present case, the mere fact of having organised a trade union
assembly should not have resulted in the detention of the trade union leaders
and trade unionists involved.   Therefore, the Committee regrets the detention
of these trade union leaders and trade unionists and draws the attention
of the Government to the fact that detention of trade union leaders for
activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary
to the principles of freedom of association [see, for example, 218th Report,
Case No. 1129 (Nicaragua), para. 477].   Furthermore, in view of the fact
that the period of detention lasted more than 20 days, and that none of
the trade unionists was brought to trial, the Committee would emphasise
the principle that any person who is detained should immediately be brought
before the competent court.

	542.	Finally, the Committee notes that, according to the detainees themselves,
they were not dismissed, as they do not work in an employment relationship
but as a crew engaged under a contract for services, although since being
detained they have been unable to obtain contracts with building enterprises,
only with individuals.   The Committee also notes that, according to the
authorities, the persons concerned do not appear to be actually working
in the construction industry.

E.
Conclusions of the Committee on Case No. 1328

	543.	The Committee observes that the complainant organisation mainly objects
to the recognition by the Ministry of Labour on 17 October 1984 of the
executive committee elected at an assembly to reorganise the National Union
of Construction Workers (SINATRAC), held on 13 October 1984 and led by
the Secretary-General of that organisation, Milciades Giménez Díaz, a supporter
of government policy.

	544.	The Committee also observes that, some months earlier, on 11 March
1984, a split occurred in the executive committee of SINATRAC, dividing
it into two different factions:  one headed by Milciades Giménez Díaz,
Secretary-General of SINATRAC, and the other by Lino Gómez, Deputy Secretary-General
of SINATRAC.   Each faction organised an assembly to elect a new executive
committee, as the term of office of the existing committee was due to expire
on 18 October 1985.   Thus, the faction led by Milciades Giménez Díaz called
an assembly on 13 October 1984, while the faction led by Lino Gómez called
another for 14 October 1984, although the latter was postponed by the police
and was held on 21 October 1984.

	545.	On 17 October 1984, as stated, the Government recognised the executive
committee elected at the assembly of 13 October 1984 led by Milciades Giménez
Díaz.   However, when it was informed of the executive committee elected
on 21 October 1984 at the assembly led by Lino Gómez, the competent authority
of the Ministry of Justice and Labour notified Lino Gómez on 21 November
1984 of the text of a decision of the legal consultant's office stating
that recognition could not be granted since "by Resolution No. 1717 dated
17 October of the current year the Labour Directorate registered the National
Union of Construction Workers, whose executive committee is currently in
office, and its term of office is due to expire in 1987 according to its
statutes".   A subsequent decision issued by the legal consultant's office,
notified by the Director of Labour on 15 February 1985, stated that an
appeal could be lodged through the administrative disputes procedure.

	546.	The Committee concludes that the authorities of the Ministry of Justice
and Labour, aware of the existence of two assemblies to elect a new executive
committee, appear to have based their recognition of one of the committees
on considerations of time alone,
that is, on the fact that the executive
committee elected at the assembly led by Milciades Giménez Díaz was the
first to apply for recognition.   The Committee observes that the competent
authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour, referring to the allegations,
told the representative of the Director-General that the situation was
sometimes confusing, in the general context of the internal disagreement
among the members of the executive committee of SINATRAC.   According to
the ministry authorities, once Lino Gómez had been informed of the decision
to recognise the executive committee elected on 13 October 1984, he could
have lodged an administrative appeal against that decision.

	547.	The Committee considers that, irrespective of whether such an appeal
was possible (which Lino Gómez's group denies), the decision of 17 October
1984 of the Ministry of Justice and Labour to recognise the executive committee
elected by the assembly of 13 October 1984 constitutes a decision that
was arbitrary and taken in too great haste.   The Ministry was fully aware
that another duly convened assembly was to be held a few days later (on
21 October) for the same purpose.   The Committee would like to point out
that when internal disputes arise in a trade union organisation they should
be resolved by the persons concerned, by appointing an independent mediator
with the agreement of the parties concerned, or by intervention of the
judicial authorities.

F.
Conclusions on Case No. 1341

	548.	The Committee observes that the representative of the Director-General
was able to note the police surveillance and shadowing to which Ricardo
Esperanza Leiva, former leader of the Liebig Refrigeration Union and leader
of the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in Exile (CPTE), is being subjected.
The Committee requests the Government to alter what it calls the methods
of protecting the life and safety of Mr. Leiva so that, if considered objectively,
there can be no confusion with police surveillance.

	549.	Furthermore, the Committee notes that, according to the Government,
Mr. Marcelino Corazón Medina has been released.   The Committee requests
the Government to send its observations on the alleged torture of this
trade union leader indicating what were the concrete facts leading to his
detention, as well as on the alleged detention of Sebastián Rodríguez,
Secretary-General of the Drivers' Union of Line 21.

The Committee's recommendations

	550.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:

	The Committee notes that a direct contacts mission visited the country
from 23 to 27 September 1985.

Case No. 1204

(a)
The Committee draws attention in general terms to the principle that
the arrest or detention of trade union leaders and trade unionists for
activities connected with the exercise of trade union rights is contrary
to the principles of freedom of association.

(b)
In view of the fact that, according to the Government, there is no reason
from the legal standpoint why the Union of Journalists of Paraguay should
not be set up, the Committee hopes that this union will apply for and be
granted legal personality in the near future.

(c)
The Committee draws attention to the principle that no worker should
be dismissed or subjected to other acts of discrimination in employment
for carrying out trade union activities.

Case No. 1275

(a)
The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, the Labour
Appeals Court, by decision of 27 December 1984, decided in favour of the
claims of the Union of Employees of the Bank of Brazil on the matters in
dispute regarding the renewal of the collective agreement.

(b)
The Committee notes that the matter of the dismissal of trade unionists
Duarte, Virgili and Cáceres is pending judgement in court.   The Committee
adjourns its examination of this matter until judgement is pronounced,
and requests the Government to transmit a copy of the judgement as soon
as it is handed down.

Case No. 1301

(a)
The Committee regrets the detention of five trade union leaders and
trade unionists of the National Union of Construction Workers.

(b)
The Committee reiterates the principle that the detention of trade union
leaders for activities connected with the exercise of
trade union rights
is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
(c)
In view of the fact that the period of detention lasted more than 20 days
and that none of the five trade unionists was brought to trial, the Committee
stresses the principle that any person who is detained must be brought
without delay before the competent court.

Case No. 1328

(a)
The Committee considers that the decision of 17 October 1984 of the
Ministry of Justice and Labour to recognise the executive committee of
SINATRAC, elected by the assembly held on 13 October 1984, taken in full
awareness that another regularly convened assembly was to be held for the
same purpose a few days later on 21 October, constitutes an arbitrary and
too speedy decision.

(b)
The Committee draws attention to the fact that when internal disputes
arise in a trade union organisation, they should be resolved by the persons
concerned, by appointing an independent mediator with the agreement of
the parties concerned, or by intervention of the judicial authorities.

Case No. 1341

(a)
The Committee requests the Government to change what it calls the methods
of protecting the life and safety of Mr. Leiva so that, if objectively
considered, there can be no confusion with police surveillance.

(b)
The Committee notes that Mr. Marcelino Corazón Medina has been released.
The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the
alleged torture of this trade union leader stating what were the concrete
facts leading to his detention, as well as on the detention of Sebastián
Rodríguez, Secretary-General of the Drivers' Trade Union of Line 21.

ANNEX

REPORT OF MR. GERALDO VON POTOBSKY ON THE
DIRECT CONTACTS MISSION CARRIED OUT IN PARAGUAY
(23-27 SEPTEMBER 1985)

	1.	At the 71st Session of the International Labour Conferenc (Geneva,
1985), the Government representative of Paraguay informed the Committee
on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations that
"his Government
has requested a direct contacts mission to deal specifically with the application
of Conventions Nos. 87 and 98" (both ratified by Paraguay), and pointed
out that "the direct contacts will be carried out with the presence of
the three groups (government, employers' organisations and workers' organisations).
The Workers' member of Austria (Mr. Maier) "hoped that when the direct
contacts mission went to Paraguay it would also deal with the cases pending
before the Committee on Freedom of Association".

	2.	For their part the Workers' members of Uruguay and Argentina expressed
their hope that the mission would be able to make contact with the Paraguayan
Confederation of Workers in Exile.

	3.	Following the discussion of the case of Paraguay in the Committee on
the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, the Government sent
to the Office a communication dated 28 June 1985 in which it expressedly
requested that the direct contacts mission to be carried out should also
examine the cases pending before the Committee on Freedom of Association.

	4.	The Director-General of the ILO appointed me as his representative
to carry out this mission, which took place between 23 and 27 September
in Asunción and which also included a visit to Buenos Aires on 21 September
with a view to establishing contact and holding discussions with the Paraguayan
Confederation of Workers in Exile (CPTE).   I was accompanied on the mission
by Mr. Alberto Odero, member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the
International Labour Standards Department, and by Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional
Adviser on standards.

	5.	During the mission we met Mr. Eugenio Jacquet, Minister of Justice
and Labour, and Mr. Carlos Doldán del Puerto, Director of Labour, and had
several meetings with the latter and his collaborators.   We also spoke
with representatives of the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers (CPT),
the Federation of Production, Industry and Commerce (FEPPINCO), the Paraguayan
Industrial Union, the Federation of Bank Employees (FETRABAN) and the National
Union of Building Workers (SINATRAC) as well as other trade union leaders,
trade unionists and interested parties.   The list of these persons appears
at the end of this report.

	6.	It was not possible to arrange a meeting with the Minister of the Interior
or any other high official of this Ministry, before whom we should have
liked to place certain specific allegations falling within their sphere
of competence (Cases Nos. 1204 and 1341) in order to obtain information
and comments.

	7.	During the meeting with the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers in
Exile (CPTE), its leaders provided us with information on the trade union
situation in their country and expressed their surprise that this had been
the first time that the ILO was carrying out a mission of this kind in
Paraguay.   Furthermore, they made a formal observation concerning the
time which had elapsed concerning
the examination of the complaints presented.
Finally, they requested that the Ministry of Justice and Labour should
be informed concerning the imminent return to the country of Mr. Julio
Etcheverry Espínola, Secretary-General of the organisation, who hoped to
be able to enjoy all his constitutional rights.   The Minister of Justice
and Labour stated that Mr. Etcheverry would enjoy these rights like any
other citizen, provided that he observed the law of the country.

	8.	I should like to place on record that I was given every assistance
by the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour in carrying out
the mission for which I am extremely grateful.   I should also like to
thank all those persons interviewed for the information which they provided.

	9.	The present report includes various documents which we received during
the course of the mission for the purposes of our inquiry.

Cases pending before the Committee on
Freedom of Association

	10.	At present five complaints against the Government of Paraguay (Cases
Nos. 1204, 1275, 1301, 1328 and 1341) are pending before the Committee
on Freedom of Association.   The Committee examined Cases Nos. 1204 and
1275 at its meeting of November 1984 (see 236th Report of the Committee,
paragraphs 426-44 and 448-458) and presented an interim report to the Governing
Body since the Government had not responded to certain matters or was requested
to provide additional information.

	11.	The Government representative to the 71st Session of the International
Labour Conference handed the Office a series of documents which contained
information concerning Cases Nos. 1204, 1275 and 1301.   No observations
from the Government were received concerning Cases Nos. 1328 and 1341.

	12.	During the mission we discussed the matters raised in the cases before
the Committee on Freedom of Association with officials of the Ministry
of Labour and various interested parties.

Case No. 1204

	13.	This complaint was presented by the International Confederation of
Free Trade Unions in communications dated 20 and 27 May, 13 October and
16 December 1983.   The Government sent certain observations in a communication
dated 14 September 1984.   The Committee on Freedom of Association examined
the case, as already
noted, at its meeting of November 1984 and made the
following recommendations which summarise with sufficient clarity the matters
which remained pending (see 236th Report, paragraph 443):

	(a)
Regarding the arrest of 19 members of the the Trade Union Solidarity
Movement (MSS) as part of a campaign of repression following the setting
up of this organisation, the Committee observes that, according to the
Government, one of the persons concerned is a fugitive from justice who
has not been arrested and 13 others were released without the judicial
authorities upholding any charges against them.   The Committee deeply
regrets that these 13 trade unionists were deprived of their freedom for
more than a year in most cases and draws the Government's attention to
the fact that the arrest and detention of trade union leaders and trade
unionists for trade union reasons constitute a violation of the principles
of freedom of association.   The Committee requests the Government to send
its observations on the arrest of Stella Rufinelli, Margarita Elías, Damián
Vera, Juan Carlos Oviedo and María Herminia Feliciangeli following the
setting up of the MSS of which they are said to be members.

	(b)
The Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the remaining
allegations:  the difficulties encountered by the Union of Journalists
of Paraguay (SPP) for the past four years in its attempts to obtain legal
personality;  the threatened exile of the leaders and members of the SPP;
the arrest and trial of the leader of the SPP, Alcibiades González del
Valle;  the arrest of Aldo Zucalillo, director of ABC Color for allowing
the publication of matters of trade union interest;  the threats against,
harassment of and restrictions imposed on this newspaper for publishing
the setting up of the MSS;  the arrest of Dr. Jorge Alvarenga and Dr. Carlos
Cuevas during a round-table discussion on "trade unionism and repression";
the arbitrary dismissal of the workers from the La Americana SA textile
company following the submission by the trade unions of a list of demands;
the threatened dismissal of 800 workers of the FRISA SA company following
the request by the trade unions for payment of unpaid wages;  the closing
down of Radio Ñandutí for transmitting messages from the Paraguayan Confederation
of Workers in Exile and a ban on the commentator and director of the radio
station from exercising his profession.   The Committee requests the Government
to send its observations on this matter without delay.

	14.	The Government provided the following information during the 71st
Session of the International Labour Conference:
-
All the persons arested for infractions of Act No. 209 to which the
complainant had referred are now free.   María Herminia Feliciangeli was
held under arrest between 11 May and 18 September 1983;  Margarita Elías
Acosta, from 11 May to 18 September 1983;  María Estela Rufinelli, from
11 to 30 May 1983;  Juan Carlos Oviedo, from 11 to 16 May 1983;  and Pedro
Damían Vera, from 12 to 24 May 1983.

-
The Union of Journalists of Paraguay requested its recognition in 1979.
The authorities noted substantial errors in the setting up of the trade
union which needed to be remedied;  in particular, an association with
the same objectives, called the Press Association of Paraguay, already
existed and furthermore opposed the establishment of a new trade union;
moreover, there was no unanimous agreement between the supporters of the
trade union concerning its creation since a group of journalists opposed
its establishment.   In the circumstances, the Labour Directorate informed
the applicants on 6 September 1983 that they would first of all have to
resolve their existing internal problems before any decision could be taken
concerning the recognition of the union.   Since then, none of the necessary
formalities has been taken with a view to the registration of the union.

-
Carlos Cuevas Miranda, a doctor, was arrested on 4 July 1983.   Legal
proceedings were initiated against him for infraction of Act No. 209.
He was released from prison on 11 July 1983 on the instructions of the
Judge of the Penal Court of the First Instance and at the present time
is living and exercising his profession near Caaguazú.

-
Jorge Alvarenga Galeano, who was born in Buenos Aires, was arrested
on 22 June 1983 opposite the Faculty of Engineering, for shouting slogans
against the country, the Government and the authorities whilst meeting
with a group of students who had been suspended by the rector of the National
University.   On 5 July 1983 he was deported to Buenos Aires but re-entered
Paraguay on 6 February 1984 and left again on his own initiative on 10
February 1984 without any intervention by the Paraguayan authorities.

-
In the América Textil undertaking a trade union requested recognition
of its occupational status on 26 December 1979.   The Labour Inspectorate
observed that it did not have the number of members required by law since
a large number of the applicants were in fact workers who had been dismissed
or who had received advance notice of dismissal.   Subsequently, no new
steps have been taken with a view to its registration.

-
With respect to the allegation concerning the FRISA SA undertaking,
no information is available in the Labour Directorate concerning the threats
of dismissal alleged by the complainant.

	15.	During the mission we were able to gather the following information
on these various matters.

	16.	With regard to the alleged detention of Stella Rufinelli and four
other persons following the establishment of the MSS, the authorities of
the Ministry of Justice and Labour stated that these persons were free
(in conformity with the information supplied by the Government representative
to the 71st Session of the International Labour Conference), that they
had been arrested during an investigation into the "Paraguayan Data Bank"
affair and that they were never taken to court.   We were informed that
the "Paraguayan Data Bank" was an intelligence unit which acted as the
headquarters for conspiratorial activities of a Marxist-Leninist nature.
Under the cover of its supposed data processing activities, its real
function was of a subversive nature.

	17.	As regards the alleged difficulties of the Union of Journalists of
Paraguay (SPP) over the past four years to obtain legal personality, the
authorities of the Ministry referred to the information supplied by the
Government representative to the 71st Session of the International Labour
Conference and stressed that this trade union had taken no new steps with
a view to obtaining legal personality and that there was no legal impediment
to the establishment of the trade union.   We invited Mr. José Gaspar Meaurio,
the current Secretary-General of the trade union, to a meeting to discuss
these matters, but he did not attend.   As regards the arrest and prosecution
of Mr. Alcibiades González del Valle, leader of the Union of Journalists
of Paraguay, the authorities of the Ministry pointed out that this person
is free and freely exercising his professional activity at the present
time.   In the past he had been arrested on several occasions but never
for trade union reasons.   It should be noted that Mr. González del Valle,
who is no longer the Secretary-General of the Union of Journalists of Paraguay,
was invited to meet with the representative of the Director-General of
the ILO but did not come.

	18.	As regards the arrest of Mr. Aldo Zuccolillo, Director of the newspaper
ABC Color, for permitting publications on trade union events, the authorities
of the Ministry pointed out that the reason for the arrest was not that
given by the complainant but rather his systematic and abusive harassment
of the Government.   Furthermore, they emphasised that Mr. Zuccolillo had
never allowed the establishment of any trade union in the undertakings
of which he is the owner.   Finally, they stated that trade union newspapers
which published articles of a critical nature existed in the country and
that such publications had never been the subject of any penalties or warnings.

	19.	As regards the arrest of Messrs. Carlos Cuevas and Jorge Alvarenga Galeano,
the authorities of the Ministry stated that they were not trade unionists,
that their detention was not related to trade union matters and that they
were released without legal proceeding being brought against them.

	20.	As regards the alleged arbitrary dismissal of workers of the América
Textil undertaking following the submission by the trade unions of a list
of demands, the authorities of the Ministry stated that 27 workers were
dismissed in December 1979.   In January 1980 a works union requested recognition
in the Ministry but this was refused since of its founding members only
12 were actually employed (the Labour Code stipulates a minimum number
of 30).   In any event, the dismissed workers accepted the legal indemnities.
It should be noted that the América Textil undertaking refused to meet
with the representative of the Director-General of the ILO.

	21.	As regards the allegations concerning the FRISA S.A. undertaking,
the authorities of the Ministry stated that no undertaking existed with
that name.

	22.	Finally, with respect to the closing down of the Ñandutí radio station,
the authorities of the Ministry denied that the reason for this action
was the transmission of messages from the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers
in Exile.   The radio station was closed for political reasons.   They
stated that in Paraguay radio stations are not closed down for giving news
or messages of a trade union nature.

Case No. 1275

	23.	This complaint was presented by the International Confederation of
Free Trade Unions in a communication dated 17 April 1984.   The Government
sent certain observations in a communication dated 14 September 1984.
The Committee on Freedom of Association examined the case, as noted earlier,
at its meeting of November 1984, and made the following recommendations
which summarise with sufficient clarity the matters which remained pending
(see 236th report, paragraph 458):

	(a)
The Committee expresses the hope that the Labour Court will shortly
decide the points of contention in connection with the renewal of the collective
agreement between the Union of Employees of the Bank of Brazil and this
same bank, which expired on 30 January 1983.   It draws attention to the
obligation on both employers and trade unions to bargain in good faith
to reach an agreement and stresses that satisfactory labour relations depend
primarily on the attitudes of the parties towards each other and on their
mutual confidence.   The Committee requests the Government to inform it
of the Labour Court's decision on this case.

	(b)
The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of
the judicial appeal concerning the dismissal of Messrs. Rolando Duarte,
Adolfo Virgili y Guillermo and Guillermo Cáceres, members of the Union
of Employees of the Bank of Brazil.

	24.	The Government had sent copies of certain documents concerning the
alleged dismissals, but had not sent the text of the judgement.   Neither
had it sent the text of the judicial decision on the points of contention
related to the renewal of the collective agreement.

	25.	During the mission we were able to gather the following information
on these various matters.

	26.	The authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour provided the
text of the decision of the Labour Appeal Court dated 27 December 1984
upholding the claims of the Union of Employees of the Bank of Brazil concerning
the points of contention regarding the renewal of the collective agreement.
The management of the Bank of Brazil and leaders of the Federation of
Bank Employees pointed out that the Bank of Brazil and the trade union
of this institution had recently signed a new collective agreement.

	27.	As regards the alleged dismissal of Messrs. Roland Duarte, Adolfo 
Virgili and Guillermo Cáceres, members of the Union of Employees of the
Bank of Brazil, the leaders of the Federation of Bank Employees who were
interviewed stated that these dismissals were illegal since they violated
the provisions of section 285 of the Labour Code (maintenance of the employment
relationship during the settlement of labour disputes procedure).   They
pointed out that although the undertaking claimed that the dismissals were
made in order to reduce costs they were, in fact, due to trade union activities.
Messrs. Virgili and Cáceres were very active members of the trade union
and Mr. Roland Duarte was its former Deputy Secretary-General.   Furthermore,
if the argument concerning the reduction of costs were true, the Bank could
have dismissed other persons since 20 workers were nearing retirement and
their departure from the undertaking would not have prevented them from
receiving their legal retirement benefits.   In the same way, when the
arbitration award was made concerning the points of contention in the new
collective agreement, and which upheld the claims of the trade union, the
undertaking dismissed two further members.

	28.	The management of the Bank of Brazil denied that the dismissal of
Messrs. Duarte, Virgili and Cáceres was of an anti-trade union nature or
related to collective bargaining.   All the workers of the Bank were members
of the trade union and the dismissed workers were not members of the executive
board of the trade union.   The dismissal of the workers in question was
due to administrative reasons and not to a reduction in costs and the workers
concerned received the compensation prescribed by law.   Subsequent to
these measures there was only one other dismissal, that of a worker in
another branch of the Bank, and the departure from the undertaking of a
secretary by mutual agreement.   The secretary went to work in another
banking institution.

	29.	The authorities of the Ministry stated that no definitive ruling had
been issued concerning the dismissals and that the judiciary had indicated
that such a ruling was imminent.

Cases Nos. 1328 and 1301

	30.	It appears appropriate to treat these two cases together and in the
above-mentioned order because of the close relationship which exists between
specific aspects of these cases and a full understanding of the matters
in question.

Case No. 1328

	31.	The complaint appears in a communication from the Latin American Central
of Workers (CLAT) dated 6 April 1985.   The Government has still not furnished
a reply.

	32.	The CLAT alleges in particular that the authorities have limited the
right of the National Union of Building Workers (SINATRAC) to elect its
representatives in full freedom.

	33.	More precisely, the CLAT alleges that the Labour Directorate stated
in a communication of September 1984 that the extraordinary assembly held
on 11 March 1984 to replace the Secretary-General of SINATRAC, Mr. Milciades
Giménez Díaz for failure to fulfil his duties, was null and void for procedural
reasons.   According to the complainant, the real reason for this measure
was that the above-mentioned trade union leader supported the anti-trade
union policy of the Government.   CLAT encloses a copy of the communication
from the Labour Directorate (dated 19 June 1984) in which it is stated
that SINATRAC "should have justified previously that it had observed the
provision of Article 6 of its by-laws.   Thus the copy of the ABC newspaper
presented contains only information of a journalistic nature which cannot
be considered as the convocation of an assembly of its members which would
have legal force".

	34.	CLAT adds that the ordinary general assembly of SINATRAC which had
been called by the trade union executive for 14 October 1984 was suspended
by the authorities.   CLAT includes a copy of a communication from the
Labour Directorate dated 31 October 1984 stating that those who called
the assembly "were not accredited members of the trade union and thus are
not empowered to call an assembly".

	35.	CLAT adds that the ordinary general assembly was then convened for
2l October 1984;  it took place in normal conditions with the members of
the union and presented in good time its request to the Labour Directorate
for recognition of the executive committee.   However, this request was
rejected on the grounds that "an executive
committee had already been recognised
on the same date" when in fact - the complainant goes on - this had occurred
without the convening of an assembly or the observance of any of the necessary
requirements and within a period of 24 hours.   As a consequence, a complaint
was lodged which was not answered, thus preventing a discussion of the
matter in other bodies, including in the courts (it should be noted that
CLAT sends as an annexure a communication from the Labour Directorate which
implicitly refers to the possibility of lodging an administrative appeal).

	36.	CLAT concludes by pointing out that the leader recognised by the authorities
does not represent the working classes and has always acted like a vigilante
against the interests of his trade union comrades.

	37.	In order to obtain information on this complaint, which basically
deals with the rift which occurred in the executive committee of SINATRAC
and its consequences, we consulted the representatives of both groups as
well as the competent authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour.

	38.	We met with Messrs. Lino Gómez,  Gregorio Ojeda and Melanio Morel,
who stated that they were respectively Secretary-General, Assistant Secretary-General
and Financial Secretary of SINATRAC.   These persons belong to the group
which presented the complaint to the ILO.   They furnished us with various
documents to support and supplement their oral statements.

	39.	According to the information provided, during the extraordinary assembly
of 11 March 1984 the question was implicitly raised of unionising the workers
of the Yaciretá dam and the private firm which was constructing the future
plant of ACEPAR (Paraguayan Steelworks).   All those present supported
this action by the trade union although the Secretary-General, Mr. Melcíades
Giménez Díaz, opposed it.   The latter, having refused to read a document
which was given to him concerning this matter, decided to leave the meeting
accompanied by the Clerk, Mr. Sixto Fleitas.   In the circumstances, the
participants decided to elect Mr. Lino Gómez (who until then had been the
Assistant Secretary-General) as the new Secretary-General.   He was to
exercise his mandate until the month of October 1984, when the term of
the executive committee was due to expire.    At the same time, the assembly
reorganised the executive committee and sent the corresponding notice to
the Labour Directorate with a view to obtaining recognition of this committee.

	40.	In reply, they were informed in a note of 19 June 1984 of the legal
ruling of 7 June concerning the need to fulfil, before the holding of the
assembly, the statutory regulations concerning the publication of the convocation
in a newspaper.   In a note of 3 July 1984, issued by the new executive
committee, it was explained to the authorities of the Ministry of Justice
and Labour that it had not been possible to publish the convocation due
to lack of money but that the news item which had appeared in the ABC Color
newspaper compensated
for this shortcoming.   Furthermore, approximately
80 members of the trade union out of a total of 120 had attended the assembly,
which was well beyond the required quorum.   Despite these explanations,
the Labour Directorate issued a resolution dated 6 September 1984 which
rejected the recognition of the executive committee and based its decision
on the failure to observe the above-mentioned statutory provision.

	41.	In these circumstances, the complainants add, the failure to recognise
this new Committee implied that the previous committee remained in existence.
Seven members of this committee (out of a total of 11), including Messrs.
Lino Gómez and Gregorio Ojeda, decided to convene an ordinary assembly
of the trade union for 14 October 1984.   This decision was communicated
to the Ministry on 26 September and the convocation was published in a
newspaper in accordance with the union's by-laws.   In the same way notification
was sent to the police which replied that the assembly would have to be
postponed until 21 October.   For its part, the Legal Department of the
Labour Directorate decided that the applicants were not accredited members
(of the executive committee) of the trade union, and thus could not convene
the assembly.   This decision was communicated to them on 31 October.
The assembly took place on 21 October and recognition of the elected
executive committee was requested in a note dated 24 October 1984.   The
competent authority of the Ministry replied by providing the text of another
legal opinion which stated that, by Resolution No. 1717 dated 17 October
1984, recognition had already been granted to another executive committee
of the trade union and that for this reason the applicants' request could
not be accepted.

	42.	According to the complainants, what had in fact happened was that
without their knowledge, another assembly had been held on 13 October 1984
which had been called by the members of the original executive committee
who had remained in a minority.   In the extraordinarily short period of
four days, which is unprecedented, this new committee was recognised whereas
normally such a process requires more than one month.   This would also
explain the instructions from the police to postpone the date of the assembly
from 14 to 21 October.

	43.	The complainants state that they have never been able to obtain a
copy of the text of the formal resolution which rejects their request for
recognition of the executive committee elected at the assembly of 21 October
1984.   They have presented and verified before the Ministry the request
for recognition of this executive committee and the request for the annulment
of the recognition granted to the committee elected on 13 October 1984
(notes dated 28 November and 23 January 1985).   In the note dated 28 November
it is stated that the so-called assembly of 13 October did not legally
take place, that those who convened it did not have the power to do so,
that they did not publish the convocation notice as required, that they
did not have rosters available, were not up to date in their contributions
and had not distrubuted circulars concerning the convocation.

	44.	In reply, the Ministry confirmed that the only legal recourse against
the resolution to deny recognition in this case is the administrative procedure
for disputes, in accordance with section 297 of the Labour Code (note dated
15 February 1985).   According to the complainants, the initiation of this
procedure requires access to the text of the formal resolution which they
have unsuccessfully requested.

	45.	At the meeting held with Mr. Milcíades Giménez Díaz, who claimed to
be the Secretary-General of SINATRAC, he referred to various aspects of
the assembly of 11 March 1984.   First of all, the resignation presented
in February by Mr. Gregorio Ojeda, who was a member of the executive committee
elected in 1982, was accepted.   During the same assembly Mr. Pedro Zárate
also presented his resignation.   During the discussions a written note
of accusation against Mr. Gímenez was presented by the complainants requesting
his resignation as Secretary-General.   It was suggested that he should
read this note publicly but Mr. Gímenez refused to do so since the matter
was not included on the agenda of the assembly.   The text of the agenda
was shown to us by Mr. Gímenez;  it reads as follows:  "(1) Report and
appraisal of the financial situation by the Secretary of Finances for the
1983 exercise.  (2) Election of a Deputy Secretary of Records and Relations,
a Deputy Secretary of Finance and a Secretary responsible for the organisation
of activities.   (3) Election of four substitute members."   Those who
were insistent that the note should should be read included in particular
Mr. Carlos Castillo, former Secretary-General, who had ceased to be a member
of the trade union following his failure to pay trade union dues.

	46.	As a result of the rising tempers of the persons present and the resulting
confusion, Mr. Gímenez Díaz decided to withdraw from the assembly, accompanied
by the Clerk and the two inspectors of the Ministry of Justice and Labour
who had been invited by the executive committee.   The two latter officials
informed the members that the assembly was suspended and that any decision
taken by those present would have no legal effect.   Approximately 50 persons
remained in the meeting out of a total of 61 participants.   The membership
of the trade union at that time was 120.   In the meeting which continued
it was not possible to adopt any decision respecting the election of a
new Secretary-General and the reorganisaion of the executive committee
since these items were not included on the agenda.

	47.	Furthermore, Mr. Gímenez continued, it cannot be said that seven members
out of a total of 11 of the executive committee elected in 1982 had remained
as members of one of the two factions.   In fact two of the seven had resigned
or abandoned their functions before the assembly of 11 March 1984 (Florencio
Benítez, Secretary of Records and Relations, Eustaquio Portillo, Deputy
Secretary of Finances).   The following therefore remained as members of
the dissident group:  Lino Gómez, Gregorio Ojeda, Justo Pastor Sosa, Pedro
Zárate and Martín Chamorro.   In Mr. Gímenez Díaz's group there remained,
in addition to the latter, Sixto Fleitas, Antonio de la Cruz Benítez and
Efigenio Fernández.   According to Mr. Gímenez, this proves that the dissidents
did not have the support of the majority of the members of the original
executive committee to convene a subsequent extraordinary assembly of the
trade union.

	48.	After the division occurred, Mr. Gímenez Díaz adds, that the premises
of SINATRAC - an office in the headquarters of the Paraguayan Confederation
of Workers - continued to be occupied by his group, which continued its
trade union activities.    With a view to normalising the situation, it
was decided to hold an assembly for the reorganisation of the trade union,
which took place in Villa Hayes on 13 October 1984.   This city was selected
since most of the members were employed there in the construction of the
future ACEPAR plant.   More than 200 members participated in the assembly.
Circulars announcing the convocation were pinned up and distributed at
the worksite.   The assembly elected a new executive committee of which
Mr. Gímenez Díaz is the Secretary-General.   This committee was recognised
by the Ministry of Justice and Labour.

	49.	In our conversations with the competent authorities of this Ministry
we received documentation and we were given the following information on
the events which had occurred.   It was stressed that the situation was
a confused one concerning an internal dispute between the members of the
executive committee of SINATRAC.

	50.	On 11 March 1984 an extraordinary general assembly convened by the
executive committee was held in the headquarters of the Paraguayan Confederation
of Workers to examine the financial balance sheet presented by the Financial
Secretary and to fill certain vacant posts on the committee.    After the
approval of the balance sheet and as the chairman was introducing the second
item on the agenda (appointment to vacant posts), a group headed by Carlos
Castillo, Gregorio Ojeda and Pedro Zárate provoked the incidents in question,
disregarding the warnings made by the labour inspectors to keep to the
items on the agenda.   As the situation deteriorated, the inspectors withdrew
from the premises, as did the president and secretary of the meeting, and
the delegates of the CPT.

	51.	Later the group directed by Carlos Castillo, Gregorio Ojeda and Pedro
Zárate held a so-called extraordinary general assembly, set up a so-called
executive committee and requested its recognition before the Labour Directorate.
This request was denied by Resolution No. 1502 dated 6 September 1984.
Since that date the trade union had been without leadership.   In these
circumstances and with a view to the legal reorganisation of the trade
union, a SINATRAC reorganisation committee was set up whose members were
Milcíades Gímenez Díaz, Sixto Fleitas and Antonio de la Cruz Benítez, who
had been members of the executive committee elected in January 1982.
This reorganisation committee, with the collaboration of the CPT, called
a general assembly on 1 October 1984 for the reorganisation of the trade
union, to be held on 13 October in Villa Hayes.   The convocation was not
published in a newspaper for lack of money but notification was given in
circulars, as verified by the labour inspectors.   The assembly was monitored
by officials of the Labour Directorate and proceeded to
elect a new executive
committee of the trade union which was duly recognised by the authorities
by Resolution No. 1717 dated 17 October 1985.

	52.	As regards certain specific points, the labour authorities provided
the following information.   The executive committee elected in the assembly
of 11 March 1984 was not recognised because it had not complied with the
provisions of Article 6 of the SINATRAC by-laws, which read as follows:
"The convocation of an assembly of members shall be communicated to members
by means of circulars distributed at the workplaces and in the work committees
and by publication in a newspaper of the capital at least eight days beforehand."
As regards the request for recognition of the executive committee resulting
from the assembly of 21 October 1984 and the annulment of the recognition
granted to the committee elected at the assembly of 13 October 1984, the
Labour Directorate considers that this is an appeal for annulment requiring
the Directorate to annul a decision which it had previously taken.   This
kind of appeal is not applicable in such cases and is not included in any
regulation for these purposes.   What is applicable under the established
procedure (Decree No. 3696 dated 24 March 1964) is a direct appeal to the
courts through the administrative procedure for disputes.   The Ministry
of Justice and Labour communicated the legal decisions to which the complainants
refer in the same way as resolutions against which appeals can be lodged
through the administrative procedure for disputes.   Furthermore, mention
is made in one of these decisions of Resolution No. 1717 which recognises
the executive committee elected on 13 October 1984, which means that the
complainants had been informed of the existence of this resolution and
could have lodged an appeal through the adminstrative procedure for disputes.

	53.	Finally, the Labour Directorate stressed that it is not certain that
Messrs. Ojeda, Zárate, Castillo and other complainants actually work in
the building industry.   On the other hand, it was clear from the work
roster of the Benito Roggio and Sons SA., construction firm that Mr. Milciades
Gimenez Diaz is an employee of this firm.

Case No. 1301

	54.	This complaint is contained in communications from the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated 6 and 25 September 1984.
The Government representative of Paraguay to the 71st Session of the
International Labour Conference personally delivered certain information
concering this complaint.

	55.	In its communication dated 6 September 1985, the ICFTU alleges that
on 18 August 1984, when steps were being taken for the establishment of
a trade union, Messrs. Melanio Morel, Gregorio Ojeda, Pedro Zárate, Carlos
Castillo and Nicasio Guzmán, leaders of the National Union of Building
Workers (SINATRAC) were arrested in the ACEPAR iron and steel works by
military officials.   In its
communication of 25 September 1984, the ICFTU
adds that these leaders were released on lO September, but that they have
been dismissed on the express instructions of the Ministry of Justice and
Labour.

	56.	The documentation presented by the Government representative of Paraguay
to the 71st Session of the International Labour Conference indicates that
the persons mentioned by the ICFTU do not appear as members of SINATRAC,
nor are they employed in any undertaking.

	57.	Information on this case was obtained from Messrs. Lino Gómez, Gregorio
Ojeda and Melanio Morel, as well as from the competent authorities of the
Ministry of Justice and Labour.   It should be noted that the events occurred
in August 1984, that is, after the executive committee of SINATRAC had
split into two factions during the assembly of ll March of that year.

	58.	According to Messrs. Gómez, Ojeda and Morel, who were members of the
executive committee elected at that assembly, as well as Pedro Zárate,
their objective was to set up a works committee in the undertaking which
was building the ACEPAR plant.   A similar committee had previously been
set up in the Yaciretá worksite.  On 18 August 1984, they convened a assembly
of workers in this plant which was to be held at the nearest bus stop to
the plant.   On that day, as they were preparing for the meeting, they
were warned by the police that the meeting should not be held.   Shortly
afterwards they were arrested by members of the army and remained under
arrest until 4 September 1984 when they were released without any proceedings
having been brought against them.  They were not informed of the reason
for their detention but were warned not to proceed further with their activities.

	59.	According to these interlocutors, they had organised works committees
on previous occasions without having requested permission from the authorities.
On such occasions the meetings had been held in the premises of the Paraguayan
Confederation of Workers, which was impossible on this occasion because
of the large number of interested workers (approximately, 2,700).   They
had believed that the ACEPAR plant, an undertaking which is directed by
military staff, was not situated in a military zone and there was no information
or notice indicating that it was.   Finally, they stated that they were
not dismissed as a result of these events because they were not recruited
individually under separate contracts, but collectively as a team on the
basis of labour-leasing contracts.   What is certain that since their arrest
they have not been able to obtain contracts with building undertakings
as before but only with individual employers.

	60.	According to the authorities of the Ministry of Justice and Labour,
the ACEPAR undertaking is a para-public undertaking, located in a military
zone and is directed by military staff.   The assembly to which the complaints
refer was not authorised and for this reason could not be held.   As a
result they were arrested by the military forces, without charges being
brought against them, and subsequently released.   The Ministry never intervened
with a view to obtaining
their possible dismissal.  In point of fact the
matter is a problem which should be examined in the context of the rivalry
existing between the two trade union factions to which reference has been
made, and the action carried out by the complainants was designed to obtain
new supporters because of the forthcoming trade union elections.

Case No. 1341

	61.	This complaint is contained in a communication from the ICFTU dated
24 June 1985.   The Government had not replied.

	62.	The ICFTU alleges that Paraguayan citizens who were offered the possibility
of returning to their country after a long period of forced exile are being
submitted to a strict control by the authorities.   The complainant refers
in particular to the case of Mr. Ricardo Esperanza Leiva, former trade
union leader who returned to the country after many years of exile and
who has since been the victim of thorough and constant police supervision
in Asunción, including supervision by motorised police whenever he travels
to any part of the city.

	63.	The ICFTU states that this type of government measure severely limits
the individual and trade union freedoms of Mr. Esperanza Leiva and even
prevents him from seeking work, which is an indispensable condition to
be able to live and to remain the the country.

	64.	Finally, the ICFTU requests that steps be taken with a view to the
definitive lifting by the Government of the restrictions affecting exiled
citizens who have returned to the country, in particular, Mr. Esperanza Leiva.

	65.	During the mission we were able to gather the following information
on this case.

	66.	Mr. Ricardo Esperanza Leiva stated that under the pretext of guaranteeing
his personal safety he was the victim of constant supervision by the police
who followed him on motor cycles whenever he moved from one place to another.
We were able to confirm the presence of a police motor cycle opposite
the place where we met with Mr. Leiva.   According to the latter, the fact
that he is followed everywhere by the police, who also request documentation
from those persons with whom he has contact, makes it impossible for him
to find work, earn his living and therefore makes it difficult for him
to remain in the country.   Mr. Leiva said that he had been in exile since
l959, that he was sentenced to four years of prison in 1961 when he clandestinely
entered the country and joined the Epifanismo political movement.   He
also pointed out that he was a member of the Paraguayan Confederation of
Workers in Exile, acting as its Deputy Secretary-General, and that he had
been a leader of the Frigorífico Liebig trade union.

	67.	The authorities of the Ministry stated that the police surveillance
of Mr. Leiva was designed to guarantee his safety and protect his life,
since he had been a member of the Epifanismo movement, which is a specific,
dissident sector of the Colorado Party headed in 1954 by Epifanio Méndez
Fleitas, Chief of Police responsible for a number of atrocities.   The
authorities of the Ministry also pointed out that Mr. Leiva could present
his problem to the Ministry of Labour and that other trade unionists in
exile had returned to the country and were now working.

	68.	During the meeting with the Minister of Justice and Labour I expressed
the concern felt at the international level and, in particular, within
the ILO at the situation of Mr. Leiva and requested that this situation
should be made known to the Minister of the Interior.

Case No. 1219

COMPLAINT PRESENTED BY THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURE AND
ALLIED WORKERS' UNION AGAINST THE
GOVERNMENT OF LIBERIA

	551.	The Committee examined this case in February 1984 and again in May
1984, when it submitted interim reports to the Governing Body [see 233rd
Report, paras. 628-658, approved by the Governing Body at its 225th Session
(February-March 1984);  and 234th Report, paras. 585-611, approved by the
Governing Body at its 226th Session (May-June 1984)].   Subsequently, the
Government sent further information in a communication dated 15 May 1985.

	552.	Liberia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of
the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
Previous examination of the case

	553.	When the Committee examined this case at its May 1984 Session, it
made the following recommendations:
	(a)
as regards the suspension of the National Agriculture and Allied Workers'
Union of Liberia, the Committee recalls the importance it attaches to the
principle that workers' organisations must not be subject to suspension
by administrative decision.   It again urges the Government to lift without
delay the suspension order affecting the union since 15 November 1982 and
to keep it informed of any decision taken in this respect;

	(b)
as regards the labour dispute with the Firestone Plantations Company,
the suspension of the union and the dismissal of 1,200 union members employed
by the company, the Committee requests the Government to indicate whether
the dispute has been settled and, if so, whether an agreement has been
signed between the union and the employer.   It also requests the Government
to send its observations and detailed information on the alleged dismissal
of NAAWUL members employed by the Firestone Plantations Company;

	(c)
as regards the general ban on strikes introduced by Decree No. 12 of
30 June 1980, which abolished the right to strike and stipulated that labour
disputes must be arbitrated solely by the Ministry of Labour and Youth
and Sports, the Committee urges the Government to lift the ban which has
been in effect for nearly four years, and which constitutes in itself a
serious violation of trade union rights.   It again draws the attention
of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations
to this aspect of the case;

	(d)
finally, as regards the union funds originating from the World Confederation
of Labour and, specifically, the charge of embezzlement against the union's
General Secretary, the Committee considers that, in order to reach a decision
in full possession of the facts, it needs to examine the findings of the
audit of the union's accounts and requests the Government to send it a
copy of the report.

B.
The Government's reply

	554.	In its communication of 15 May 1985, the Government states that the
principle that workers' organisations must not be suspended by administrative
decision is being observed in law and in practice, and refers the Committee
to section 4103 of the Labour Practices Law.   It further states that the
suspension of NAAWUL was requested by its members who alleged that the
union's funds were being embezzled and who wished the union's accounts
to be audited;  that the suspension was a prerequisite for the audit;
and that it was lifted on 3 October 1984 after completion of the audit.

	555.	With regard to the labour dispute between NAAWUL and the Firestone
Plantations Company and the dismissal of 1,200 union members, the Government
refers to its awareness of the deadlock in negotiations between the company
and NAAWUL which was resolved by the Firestone Employees' Council before
concluding a collective agreement now in force and which will expire in
November 1985.   It denies awareness of any mass dismissal of Firestone
employees for being members of NAAWUL, and points out that section 4600(2)
of the Labour Practices Law prohibits discrimination against employees
because of membership of a labour organisation.

	556.	On the subject of the general ban on strikes introduced by Decree
No. 12 of 30 June 1980, the Government states that the measure was passed
to temporarily prevent workers from going on strike following a variety
of strikes (involving, inter alia, the destruction of property) which took
place in the aftermath of the Popular Revolution of April 1980.   It goes
on to state that, as emphasised in its previous response, the right to
strike is available under section 4503 of the Labour Practices Law, but
that the country is currently passing through a transitory period so that
the measure is necessary to maintain law and order while workers' education
is being introduced by the ILO.   The temporary ban on strikes will be
lifted as soon as the workers' education being introduced starts to bear
fruit.

	557.	Lastly, the Government denies awareness of any pending case against
any member of NAAWUL for the violation of section 4111 of the Labour Practices
Law or embezzlement of the union's funds, and states that all efforts will
be made to make a copy of the audit available to the Committee in response
to its request.

C.
The conclusions of the Committee

	558.	The Committee notes with interest the Government's statement that
the principle that workers' organisations must not be suspended by administrative
decision is being observed in law and in practice, and also that the suspension
of NAAWUL was lifted on 3 October 1984.   It observes that the suspension
of NAAWUL none the less lasted for a period of nearly one year and 11 months,
and that the courts do not appear to have been involved in this regard.
While the lifting of the suspension leads the Committee to the view that
this aspect of the case does not call for further examination, it takes
the opportunity to draw attention to the importance it attaches to the
principle established in Article 4 of Convention No. 87 that workers' and
employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended
by administrative authority.

	559.	With regard to the dispute at the Firestone Plantations Company,
the Committee regrets that the Government did not supply detailed information
relating to the allegation concerning the dismissal of 1,200 union members,
but notes the Government's denial of
any awareness of a mass dismissal
of NAAWUL members as well as the assurance contained in its statement that
discrimination against employees because of membership of a labour organisation
is prohibited.

	560.	The Committee also takes note of the Government's indication that
the dispute has been resolved as a result of an agreement concluded with
the Firestone Company's Employees' Council which is at present in force
and which expires in November 1985.   In this regard, it notes that there
is no reference to the part, if any, played by NAAWUL in any negotiations
leading to the agreement, nor is there an indication as to when the agreement
was concluded or to the date of its commencement.   In the circumstances,
the Committee requests the Government to supply it with information on
these matters.

	561.	On the subject of the general ban on strikes introduced by decree
in June 1980, the Committee reiterates its view that this in itself constitutes
a serious violation of trade union rights, and takes note of the observations
made on this subject by the Committee of Experts on the Application of
Conventions and Recommendations in 1984 and again in 1985, and of the discussions
which took place on this subject in the Committee on the Application of
Conventions and Recommendations at the 70th and 71st Sessions of the International
Labour Conference.   While noting the statement of the Government's representative
on the latter occasion that the decree was to be repealed with the introduction
of the new Labour Code, the Committee draws attention to the principle
that a general prohibition of strikes can only be justified in the event
of an acute national emergency and for a limited period of time [204th
Report, Case No. 952 (Spain), para. 161, Case No. 976 (Greece), para. 202;
214th Report, Case No. 1021 (Greece), para. 123;  234th Report, Case No.
1201 (Morocco), para. 550].   It shares the hope expressed by the Conference
Committee in 1985 that the Government will be led in the near future to
adopt the Labour Code and other necessary measures so as to take due account
of the divergencies noted by the Committee of Experts between the provision
containing the ban on strikes and the Government's obligations in terms
of Convention No. 87, especially as regards the rights of trade unions
to defend the interests of their members and to organise their activities.

	562.	The Committee notes the Government's statement that it is unaware
of any pending charge against any member of NAAWUL for violation of section
4111 of the Labour Practices Law or embezzlement of union funds.   It requests
the Government to supply it with all relevant information, including the
records of any judicial determinations, relating to the outcome of the
proceedings referred to in earlier reports on this case involving a criminal
charge of embezzlement which had been brought against the General Secretary
of NAAWUL.   It regrets that the Government has not so far made a copy
of the audit of the union's accounts available, in response to the Committee's
request and a reminder sent in July 1985, and in the circumstances renews
its request in order that it may reach a decision in full possession of
the facts concerning the allegation relating to union funds originating
from the World Confederation of Labour.

The Committee's recommendations

	563.	The Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim
report and, in particular, the following recommendations:

(a)
The Committee notes with interest the Government's statement that the
principle that workers' organisations must not be suspended by administrative
decision is being observed in law and in practice, and that the suspension
of NAAWUL was lifted in October 1984.   In the circumstances, it considers
that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.

(b)
The Committee notes, however, that the suspension was in effect for
nearly one year and 11 months, and that the courts do not appear to have
been involved in this regard;  it accordingly draws attention to the importance
it attaches to the principle established in Article 4 of Convention No.
87, namely that workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable
to be suspended or dissolved by administrative authority.

(c)
The Committee regrets that the Government did not supply detailed information
regarding the allegation concerning the dismissal of 1,200 union members
at the Firestone Plantations Company.

(d)
The Committee requests the Government to supply it with information
concerning the part, if any, played by NAAWUL in the negotiations leading
to the conclusion of a collective agreement with the Firestone Company's
Employees' Council and as to the dates on which the agreement was concluded
and entered into force.

(e)
With regard to the general ban on strikes introduced by decree in June
1980, the Committee reiterates its view that this constitutes a serious
violation of trade union rights, and draws attention to the principle that
such a prohibition can only be justified in the event of an acute national
emergency and for a limited period of time;  it shares the hope of the
Conference Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations
in 1985 that the Government will in the near future adopt the Labour Code
and other necessary measures which will enable due account to be taken
of the divergencies between the provision containing the ban on strikes
and the Government's obligations in terms of Convention No. 87, especially
as regards the rights of trade unions to defend the interests of their
members and to organise their activities.

(f)
The Committee requests the Government to supply it with the audit of
the union's accounts and all relevant information (including the record
of any judicial determinations) relating to the outcome of proceedings
referred to in earlier reports on this case involving a criminal charge
of embezzlement which had been brought against the General Secretary of
NAAWUL, so that it may reach a decision in full possession of the facts
concerning the
allegation of misuse of union funds originating from the
World Confederation of Labour.

Case No. 1250

COMPLAINT PRESENTED BY THE NATIONAL FEDERATION
OF INDEPENDENT TRADE UNIONS AGAINST
THE GOVERNMENT OF BELGIUM

	564.	The National Federation of Independent Trade Unions (UNSI) submitted
a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in Belgium in a communication
dated 18 June 1983.   The complainant organisation sent additional information
in a communication dated 13 December 1983.   In addition, it sent a telegram
to the Chairman of the Governing Body of the ILO during the 70th Session
of the International Labour Conference on 19 June 1984.   Finally, the
complainant presented further allegations in a communication dated 8 November
1984.

	565.	The Government sent very detailed information in letters dated 2
and 11 May 1984.   Subsequently, in communications dated October 1984 and
April 1985, it requested the Committee to adjourn examination of this case
on the grounds that the decisions concerning the renewal of the terms of
office of the members of the National Labour Council were due to be taken
later.

	566.	At its November 1984 meeting, the Committee on Freedom of Association
decided to adjourn examination of the case, as indicated in paragraph 6
of its 236th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its 228th Session
(Geneva, November 1984).   Since no reply had been received from the Government,
the Committee again adjourned examination of the case in February and in
May 1985 [238th Report, paragraph 5 and 239th Report, paragraph 10].
However, given the time which had elapsed since the complaint had been
lodged, the Committee pointed out to the Government in May 1985 that it
would have to examine the substance of the case at its November 1985 meeting
even if no detailed reply had been received from the Government.   Since
then, the Government sent its observations in a communication dated 24 September
1985.

	567.	Belgium has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of
the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
The complainant's allegations

	568.	The National Federation of Independent Trade Unions (UNSI), in its
letter of 18 June 1983, had alleged that the Government of Belgium granted
powers of monopoly to "political" trade unions and was seeking to paralyse
the independent union organisations.   The latter therefore together had
decided to form the National Federation of Independent Trade Unions in
October 1982.   This Federation grouped the following nine unions:  (1) the
Cartel of Independent Trade Unions;  (2) the United Union of Finance Personnel;
(3) the Belgian General Union of Sales Representatives;  (4) the General
Association of Flemish Trade Unions;  (5) the General Federation of Teachers;
(6) the National Confederation of Executive Staff (CNC);  (7) the Independent
General Trade Unions;  (8) the National Belgian Police Union;  (9) the
Independent Union of Railwaymen.

	569.	The UNSI submitted a complaint of infringement of Conventions Nos. 87
and 98 against the Government of Belgium in respect of both the public
and private sectors.

	570.	With regard to the private sector, the complainant alleged that the
Government was refusing to allow its representatives to sit on the National
Labour Council, and that the trade union allowances paid in this sector
constituted a means of pressurising workers to induce them to join unions
close to the Government since, in many cases, the allowances amount to
more than half the trade union dues.

	571.	The complainant organisation had explained that trade union life
in the private sector was completely dominated by the National Labour Council
since its members obtained the status of most representative organisation.
They could then take part in trade union elections and joint consultations
with management, pay unemployment allowances, and obtain subsidies and
the right to trade union allowances for their affiliated members.   Admission
to the Council - which is regulated by the Act of 29 May 1952 - was subject
only to two criteria:  that the organisation be established at the national
level and that it be inter-occupational.   The complainant organisation
believed that it was entitled to admission as it satisfied both requirements.

	572.	The UNSI had stated that since the Act provided for a maximum of
24 seats on the National Labour Council and only 22 of these seats had
been allocated by 25 November 1980 (as could be seen from the Royal Order
of 10 November 1980), it had submitted an application to the Minister of
Employment and Labour in view of the possibility of the two remaining seats
being allocated by Royal Order.   This application had been rejected on
the grounds that the current members' term of office was due to be renewed
in December 1984.

	573.	Furthermore, according to the UNSI, the Belgian authorities were
not complying with the principle established by the Committee on Freedom
of Association according to which, by placing one organisation
at an advantage
or at a disadvantage in relation to the others, a government might either
directly or indirectly influence the choice of workers regarding the organisation
to which they intended to belong, since they would undeniably be inclined
to join the union best able to serve them, even if their natural preference
would have led them to join another organisation for occupational, religious,
political or other reasons.   The freedom to choose was a right expressly
laid down in Convention No. 87.

	574.	According to the complainant organisation, the system of trade union
allowances in the private sector was really a means of pressurising the
workers since in many cases these allowances represented more than half
the trade union dues.   The system was thus, the UNSI maintained, contrary
to the Committee's recommendations in Case No. 981, where it had drawn
the Government's attention to the importance which it attached to the fact
that any advantage granted by law to workers who belonged to a particular
trade union must not exceed a symbolic level, so as to ensure that in no
case could an advantage be of such a nature as to influence unduly the
workers' choice as regards the organisation to which they intended to belong.

	575.	As regards the public sector, the complainant organisation recalled
that, in accordance with the Act of 19 December 1974 concerning relations
between the public authorities and the unions of employees coming under
these authorities, this sector was also subject to representation on the
National Labour Council.   According to the complainant organisation, this
Act, which had already been the subject of complaints [Cases Nos. 655 and
981] was still not being applied because of the reluctance of the political
trade unions to accept the system of counting.   The Cartel of Independent
Trade Unions of Belgium had itself, moreover, contested the system of counting.

	576.	A Bill, No. 371, aimed at amending the Act of 19 December 1974 concerning
relations between the public authorities and the unions of employees coming
under these authorities, had been introduced.   It would deprive trade
unions which were not members of the National Labour Council of any possibility
of belonging to the three general bargaining committees, whereas formerly
this exclusion applied only to the highest committee, that is to say the
Joint Committee for the Public Services as a whole.

	577.	The UNSI considered that this Bill thus demonstrated the determination
of the Belgian Government to paralyse the functioning of an independent
union, contrary to an opinion previously expressed by the Committee on
Freedom of Association in Case No. 655 [143rd Report, paragraph 42], in
which the Committee considered that a system such as that set up by the
Act of 19 December 1974 might mean that sufficiently representative organisations,
and even the most representative organisation, in the public sector might
be excluded from the general bargaining committees on the grounds that
they were not affiliated to a trade union organisation represented on the
National Labour Council, a body which was not, however, competent with
respect to the public sector.

	578.	The complainant organisation had also criticised the fact that, according
to official statistics on the trade union allowance in the public sector,
the three unions considered to be the most representative in fact represented
only about 30 per cent of the staff in this sector.   Moreover, it believed
that the Act of 19 December 1974 would not be applied, since the three
recognised political unions would not agree to their membership being counted.
Consequently, the Act of 1 September 1980 in respect of the payment of
a trade union allowance by the public services would not be applied either,
which meant that the relative payments would still be made in accordance
with transitional provisions.

	579.	Moreover, according to the complainant organisation, Bill No. 371
- even more than the 1974 Act - would deprive organisations which are not
members of the National Labour Council of their means of action.   These
organisations would not have access to any of the bodies in which important
decisions are taken.   Furthermore, sections 16 and 17 of the Act of 19 December
1974 established a discriminatory system to the detriment of trade unions
not affiliated to an organisation represented on the National Labour Council
as regards the exercise of the most elementary rights in the field of freedom
of association;  for example, they could neither hold meetings on departmental
premises, collect trade union dues during working hours, nor monitor examinations.

	580.	In conclusion, the complainant organisation stated that no objective
and clearly defined criterion was applied for the recognition of an independent
trade union;  recognition depended solely on the political good will of
the Government - that is to say the Minister of Employment and Labour -
and the Belgian Government did not wish to accept organisations that were
not politically oriented.   The complainant organisation regretted that
the uniting of all the independent unions, from both the public and the
private sector, in a federation - the UNSI - had not had the desired influence
on developments in the trade union situation, although the independent
unions had made a point of complying with the wishes of the Government
which was willing to negotiate only with unions that are inter-occupational.

	581.	In a subsequent communication dated 13 December 1983, the complainant
organisation added that the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications decided,
on 28 October 1983, to deprive the Postal Workers' Federation (POSTBOND),
a trade union organisation representing the workers of this sector on the
administrative council of the Post Office Social Service, of its right
of representation as from 1 January 1984, replacing it by a liberal trade
union which was allegedly not representative.

	582.	Furthermore, in a communication dated 8 November 1984, the UNSI referred
to measures to implement the Act of 19 December 1974 concerning relations
between the public authorities and the unions of employees coming under
these authorities which had been adopted in the
Royal Order of 28 September
1984 published in the Official Gazette No. 105 (Moniteur Belge) dated 20
October 1984.

	583.	According to the UNSI, it was clear from this text that:

(1)
as far as the three higher committees were concerned, only trade unions
with at least one seat on the National Labour Council were entitled to
participate therein.   Other organisations might sit only on the sectoral
or special committees, whose importance was extremely limited since major
decisions concerning staff were negotiated in the three higher committees;

(2)
as regards the membership count, it did not appear to be mandatory inasmuch
as it had to be requested by the chairman of the committee - generally
the Minister.

	584.	Furthermore, the UNSI had observed that its section representing
railwaymen was unable to defend its members effectively since, under the
trade union rules of the Belgian National Railway Company, only organisations
represented on the National Labour Council were empowered to do so and
the Minister of Employment and Labour was not prepared to grant it a seat
on the Council.

B.
The Government's reply

	585.	In its communication of 2 May 1984, the Government confirmed, in
respect of its refusal to allow representatives of the complainant organisation
to sit on the National Labour Council, that during the first quarter of
1983, the UNSI had submitted an application to the Minister of Employment
and Labour to be represented on the Council.   On 5 May 1983, the general
administration of the Collective Labour Relations Department of the Ministry
of Employment and Labour had informed the General Secretary of the UNSI
that its application to be represented on the National Labour Council was
premature since the membership of the Council could not be changed before
12 December 1984, when its members' term of office was to be renewed.
Moreover, in a letter of 26 September 1983 addressed to the Vice-President
of the UNSI, the Minister of Employment and Labour had confirmed that the
organisation's application to be represented on the National Labour Council
would be considered when the membership of the Council was being renewed,
the procedure for which was to begin in June 1984.

	586.	The Government explained that section 2(2) of the Act of 29 May 1952
to establish a National Labour Council read as follows:

	The members shall be appointed by the Crown.   They shall comprise representatives
in equal numbers of the most representative organisations of employers
and of the most representative organisations of workers ...
	The members representing the most representative organisations of workers
shall be selected from among candidates nominated on a double list by the
inter-occupational organisations federated at the national level.

It also pointed out that section 5 of the same Act of 29 May 1952 provided
that members of the National Labour Council were appointed for a period
of four years and that the present members of the National Labour Council
had been appointed by Royal Order of 10 November 1980, effective as from
12 December 1980.   The renewal of their term of office was due to take
place on 12 December 1984.

	587.	The Government confirmed that only 22 seats had been allocated out
of the 24 provided for in the relevant regulations;  however, the two vacant
seats could be allocated only in accordance with the principle of parity
between delegates of employers' organisations and delegates of workers'
organisations, as laid down in section 2(2) of the afore-mentioned Act
of 29 May 1952.   Thus, according to the Government, before allowing a
workers' organisation to be represented on the National Labour Council,
it was indispensable not only to investigate the representativity of that
organisation but also, in view of the principle of parity on the National
Labour Council and of the required balance between representatives of the
two sides, to carry out a fresh study of the representativity of all the
organisations of employers and the workers.   The Minister of Employment
and Labour had therefore rightly considered that in view of the scope of
this study it should be undertaken as part of the normal procedure for
the renewal of the term of office of the members of the Council.   He had
therefore informed the UNSI of his intention to consider this organisation's
application in June 1984.

	588.	As regards the system of trade union allowances, the Government stated
that the principle and conditions underlying the granting of a trade union
allowance or any other advantage to unionised workers were matters, in
the private sector, for consultation and collective bargaining.   There
were no laws or regulations establishing principles in this respect.
One or more trade union organisations might conclude, with the employers'
representatives or with one particular employer, a collective labour agreement
containing a clause providing for the grant of a trade union allowance
only to workers who were members of the organisations which were parties
to the agreement.   This clause, which laid down an obligation on the employer,
was the counterpart of an obligation for the signatory unions to maintain
industrial peace at the level of the sector of activity or of the undertaking.
The role of the public authorities in this area was extremely limited,
being confined to accepting to register a collective agreement with the
Collective Labour Relations Department of the Ministry of Employment and
Labour, and accepting to render binding by Royal Order a collective labour
agreement reached by a joint body.

	589.	The Government disputed the argument put forward by the complainant
organisation when it referred to recommendations made by
the Committee
on Freedom of Association in Case No. 981.   According to the Government,
Belgium law confers no special advantage on the workers of a particular
union.   The Royal Orders rendering collective labour agreements binding
were submitted to the courts for verification of their legal implications
and might be quashed by the Council of State.   Moreover, collective labour
agreements that were not rendered binding might also be challenged in the
courts of law.

	590.	The Government explained that Belgian jurisprudence had on several
occasions upheld the legality of the system of advantages reserved for
unionised workers or for the members of certain unions and that the judicial
and administrative jurisdictions had specified the conditions in which
such advantages could be considered legal.   These conditions might be
summarised as follows:  the advantages must be in proportion to the contributions
paid by the unionised workers;  it was generally considered that the amount
of the allowances should in no case exceed that of the contribution paid
by the worker as a member of a union (that is to say, the annual dues paid
by members to their organisation).   The granting of advantages only to
unionised workers could not undermine the rights acquired by the workers
as a whole.   An employer could not reserve solely for unionised workers
what previously belonged to the workers as a whole.   Lastly, the advantages
must be the counterpart of the participation by workers belonging to the
organisations which had signed the agreement, in the development of the
socio-economic life of the undertaking or of the sector, and were generally
granted in exchange for the expressed or tacit undertaking by the union
to commit itself for a specific period to a policy of higher productivity
or a policy of industrial peace.

	591.	The Government therefore considered that the system of trade union
allowances granted in compliance with conditions laid down by jurisprudence
was not contrary to article 20 of the Belgian Constitution which established
freedom of association, nor to the provisions of the Act of 24 May 1921
which guaranteed this freedom of association since it protected the right
of the individual to join or not to join a particular association.

	592.	The Government had recalled that the Committee on Freedom of Association
had always recognised that the principle of freedom of choice did not prevent
making a distinction between the most representative trade union and other
trade unions or according special rights to the majority trade union, provided
the distinction was made on the basis of objective criteria.   According
to the Government, the trade union organisations sitting on joint committees
were workers' organisations which, on the basis of objective criteria laid
down by Belgian law, had been recognised as the most representative in
the sector concerned.   It therefore followed that the criterion of representativity
enabled the system of trade union allowances to satisfy one of the conditions
on which Belgian jurisprudence had made the legality of this system depend,
namely that the trade union allowance was a counterpart to the obligation
to ensure growth of productivity or maintenance of industrial peace, since
only organisations that were representative of the workers could achieve
the objectives of productivity and industrial peace in any particular sector.

	593.	In the case of the public sector, the Government, in reply to the
allegation that Bill No. 371 was of such a nature as to deprive trade union
organisations which were not members of the National Labour Council of
any possibility of participating in the three general bargaining committees,
whereas those organisations had previously been excluded only from the
highest committee, i.e. the Committee for the Public Services as a whole,
pointed out that Bill No. 371 had become law on 19 July 1983.   It explained
that the purpose of that legislation was to adopt the Act of 19 December
1974 to the new system of organisation of the State resulting from the
1980 constitutional reform and to amend provisions in respect of which
certain difficulties in their implementation had become apparent.

	594.	Consequently, section 7 of the Act of 19 December 1974 laying down
the criteria for representativity of trade union organisations sitting
on the general bargaining committees had been modified.   The former section 7
read as follows:

Section 7

	Paragraph 1.   Any trade union organisation which:

	(1)	operates at the national level;

	(2)
defends the interest of all categories of public sector staff;

	(3)
is affiliated to a trade union organisation represented on the National
Labour Council

shall be deemed representative and hence entitled to sit on the Joint Committee
for the Public Services as a whole referred to in section 3, paragraph
1, subparagraph (3).

	Paragraph 2.   Any trade union organisation which:

	(1)	satisfies the requirements of paragraph 1;

	(2)
has a paid-up membership representing at least 10 per cent of the total
staff employed in the public services referred to in section 1, paragraph
1, subparagraphs (1) and (2), to the members of whose staff the present
Act has been made applicable

shall be deemed representative and hence entitled to sit on the national
public services committee referred to in section 3, paragraph 1, subparagraph
(1).
	Paragraph 3.   Any trade union which:

	(1)	satisfies the requirements of paragraph 1; and

	(2)
has a paid-up membership representing at least 10 per cent of the total
staff employed in the public services referred to section 1, paragraph
1, subparagraphs (3), (4) and (5), to the members of whose staff the present
Act has been made applicable

shall be deemed representative and hence entitled to sit on the provincial
and local public services committee referred to in section 3, paragraph
1, subparagraph (2).

	The new section 7 reads as follows:

	Section 7

	Any trade union organisation which:

	(1)	operates at the national level;

	(2)
defends the interests of all categories of public service staff;

	(3)
is affiliated to a trade union organisation represented on the National
Labour Council

shall be deemed representative and hence entitled to sit on the Joint Committee
for the Public Services as a whole, on the national community and regional
public services committees and on the provincial and local public services
committees.

The Government explained that the representativity requirements had therefore
been standardised, since a minimum number of paid-up members was no longer
required for an organisation to be deemed representative and thus entitled
to sit on the national, community and regional public services committees
(formerly the "national public service committees"), and on the provincial
and local public services committees.   As a result, the conditions for
access to these committees were now more easily met.

	595.	The Government considered that there was no basis for the complainant's
statement that organisations which did not belong to the National Labour
Council were no longer able to sit on the three general bargaining committees,
whereas previously this applied only to the Joint Committee for the Public
Services as a whole, because the standardisation of the requirements had
made access to the other two committees easier and because these requirements
(operation at the national level, defence of the interest of all categories
of public service staff, affiliation to a trade union organisation represented
on the National Labour Council) had already existed in the original text
of the Act of 19 December 1974 for access to the Joint Committee
for the
Public Services as a whole (former section 7, paragraph 1), the national
public services committee (former section 7, paragraph 2, subparagraph 1)
and the provincial and local public service committees (former section 7,
paragraph 3, subparagraph 3).

	596.	The Government pointed out that, since no conditions for access to
the general committees had been added by the new Act, the complainant's
grievance must be interpreted as referring to the three above-mentioned
requirements (which existed before the entry into force of the Act of 19 July
1983 and which had been maintained in force by that Act), in particular
the requirement of affiliation to a trade union organisation represented
on the National Labour Council.   The Government indicated that this requirement
had been previously submitted to the Committee on Freedom of Association
for consideration in Case No. 655 and that the Committee then noted that
the Government had pointed out "that the requirement that the union must
be affiliated to a trade union organisation represented on the National
Labour Council to be entitled to sit on the general bargaining committees
is intended to prevent precedence being given to organisations of public
service employees which might tend to concern themselves purely with the
interests of their own members, without taking into account those of employees
as a whole, and the solidarity to be shown towards the latter" and "that
in view of the multiplicity of unions in the Belgian public sector it was
necessary for a selection to be made for the purposes of bargaining and
consultation".   According to the Government, the Committee had recommended
that this selection should continue to be based on an evaluation of representativity,
determined objectively, which, it stated, continued to be the practice.
It refuted the allegation that the legislation criticised by the complainant
showed a determination on the part of the Government to paralyse the functioning
of an independent trade union, thus ignoring an earlier opinion expressed
by the ILO.

	597.	On this point, the Government considered it had been established
that the new Act was primarily of a technical nature and that the amendment
of section 7 of the Act of 19 December 1974 (concerning the representativity
required for entitlement to sit on the general bargaining committees) had
had the effect of reducing the Act's requirements by standardising them.
The Government considered that there were no grounds for the allegation:
(1) first, because the independent trade unions were offered the possibility
of sitting on the various bargaining and consultation committees referred
to in sections 3, 4 and 10 of the Act of 19 December 1974 if they met the
representativity requirements set out in sections 7 and 8 of the Act.
While it was true that the complainant organisation was not currently
affiliated to a trade union organisation represented on the National Labour
Council and therefore could not be deemed representative and hence entitled
to sit on the general bargaining committees (section 7 of the Act of 19 December
1974), it was nevertheless possible for it, upon the forthcoming entry
into force of the said Act, to establish that it had the largest paid-up
membership of any of the trade union organisations not affiliated to a
trade
union organisation represented on the National Labour Council.
This membership, which amounted to at least 10 per cent of the staff of
the services coming under a sectoral committee or a special committee referred
to in section 4 of the Act, would thus allow it to sit on these committees
(section 8 of the Act);  (2) second, because the Committee on Freedom of
Association recognised in Case No. 655 (158th Report, paragraph 57) that
"the fact that the trade union organisation was debarred from membership
of joint committees did not necessarily imply infringement of the trade
union rights of that organisation;  but for there to be no infringement
two conditions must be met".   The first condition was that the question
whether or not a union was sufficiently representative to sit on such bodies
must be determined by objective criteria.   This aspect had already been
submitted for consideration to the Committee on Freedom of Association.
The Government had pointed out at the time, as regards Case No. 655 (158th
Report, paragraph 66) that objective and pre-determined criteria were applicable
to trade unions by virtue of sections 7 and 8 of the Act.   The second
condition was the guarantee granted to trade union organisations deemed
non-representative enabling them to further and defend the interests of
their members, within the meaning of Article 10 of Convention No. 87, through
the activities which they could undertake in other fields and the other
rights which they enjoyed.   This guarantee, which was independent of any
condition of representativity, was provided by the approval arrangements
set out in section 15 of the Act of 19 December 1974.   An organisation
obtained such approval by sending a copy of its rules and a list of its
officers to the authority which, in this respect, was the body with competence
in such matters.   Approval conferred on the organisation concerned the
prerogatives referred to in section 16 of the Act of 19 December 1974 (right
to intervene with the authorities on behalf of employees, to assist an
employee who has been required to justify his actions, to post notices
on the premises of the department concerned and to receive documentation
concerning staff administration).

	598.	The Government also refuted the allegation that sections 16 and 17
of the Act of 19 December 1974 established a system which discriminated
against trade union organisations which were not represented on the National
Labour Council with respect to the exercise of the most elementary rights
in the field of freedom of assocation, namely that it was impossible for
the complainant to hold meetings and to collect union dues on departmental
premises and to monitor examinations.

	599.	The Government indicated that sections 16 and 17 read as follows:

	Section 16

	
Approved trade union organisations may, under conditions laid down by the
Crown:

	(1)
intercede with the authorities on behalf of all the staff whom they
represent or on behalf of any individual employee;
	(2)
at his request, assist an employee summoned to justify his actions before
the administrative authority;

	(3)
post notices on the premises of the department concerned;

	(4)
receive general documentation concerning the administration of the staff
whom they represet.

	Section 17

	Under conditions laid down by the Crown and without prejudice to the other
prerogatives conferred upon them by the present Act, representative trade
union organisations may:

	(1)
exercise the prerogatives of approved trade union organisations;

	(2)
collect trade union dues on departmental premises during working hours;

	(3)
attend the competitive examinations and tests organised for employees,
without prejudice to the prerogatives of the examiners;

	(4)
hold meetings on departmental premises.

	600.	The Government explained that sections 16 and 17 of the Act reserved
for trade union organisations prerogatives which varied according to whether
the organisation concerned was approved or was deemed representative.
However, this was not considered by the Government to constitute discrimination
against the former type of organisation, since the Committee on Freedom
of Association had recognised (158th Report, Case No. 655, para. 57) that
certain advantages, especially with regard to representation, might, in
certain circumstances, be accorded to trade unions by reason of the extent
of their representativity.   The Government contended that the withholding
of certain prerogatives from trade union organisations which were not deemed
representative within the meaning of the Act of 19 December 1974 must be
regarded as justified.

	601.	The Government disputed the allegation that, according to official
statistics of trade union allowances paid in the public sector, the three
trade unions considered the most representative represented only about
30 per cent of staff in the sector.   It had pointed out that the Prime
Minister himself had stated that 620,391 allowances had been paid during
the reference years 1977 and 1978.   It had been established that the total
number of staff members to whom the Act respecting the trade union allowance
was applicable was equal, for the reference years 1977 and 1978 combined,
to 1,336,610 units.   According to the Government, the number of staff
to whom a trade union allowance had been paid represented 46.42 per cent
of the total.   However, this percentage (which did not correspond to that
indicated by the complainant organisation), must not be regarded as representing
the level of membership of the three trade union organisations deemed to
be the most representative.   In the first place, figures for later reference
periods were not yet available and might reveal a percentage exceeding
that mentioned above, owing to an amendment of the regulations concerning
the trade union allowance which had had the effect of increasing the number
of beneficiaries (section 4(3) of the Royal Order of 30 September 1980,
introduced by Royal Order of 18 April 1982);  in the second place, many
employees who satisfied the legal and regulatory requirements for entitlement
to this allowance had chosen not to claim it by refraining from completing
the application form which had to be addressed to the payment bodies set
up by the trade union organisations concerned.   According to the Government,
the percentage which the complainant organisation had given as corresponding
to the trade union allowance was incorrect as it did not correspond to
the figure communicated by the Prime Minister.

	602.	Regarding the allegation that the three recognised political unions
refused a membership count, the Government pointed out that a Royal Order
to implement the Act of 19 December 1974 that would shortly come into force
would have the effect of removing the transitional arrangements and instituting
a comprehensive union allowance scheme.

	603.	In a subsequent communication dated 11 May 1984, the Government stated
in connection with that part of the complaint concerning the representation
of the Postal Workers' Federation on the administration council of the
Post Office Social Service that three appeals lodged by the Federation
were before the Council of State of Belgium:  a request for the repeal
of section 13 of Royal Order No. 182 of 30 December 1982 respecting the
restructuring of the Post Office, which provided for the creation of a
supervisory body;  a request for the repeal of the Ministerial Order of
30 September 1983, which provided for the establishment of a contact committee
at the headquarters of each postal region and at the general and central
administration of the postal service;  and a request for the repeal of
the Ministerial Order of 28 October 1983 approving the association referred
to in the National Federation of Independent Trade Union's complaint, which
was an association engaged in social assistance activities for post office
staff.   The Government considered that it had to await the outcome of
these internal appeals before taking a stand on an international appeal.

	604.	In its communication of 12 October 1984, the Government had requested
that examination of the case be adjourned on the grounds that the decisions
concerning the renewal of the terms of office of the members of the National
Labour Council were due to be taken at the end of the year.   It renewed
its request for adjournment on several occasions, the last being in May
1985.

	605.	Since then, the Goverment sent a reply dated 24 September 1985.
It points out that the renewal of the terms of office of the members of
the National Labour Council had been due in December 1984 but that some
difficulties had arisen concerning distribution in the
employers' group
and that it was only in the month of August 1985 that the latter had been
able to adopt a final stand.   Under the provisions of the Royal Decree
of 18 July 1985, it increased the number of members of the National Labour
Council from 22 to 24, as permitted by the Act of 19 May 1952, and, by
Royal Decree of 26 July 1985, it appointed eight representatives of the
Federation of Belgian Enterprises, three representatives of the Higher
Council of Employers in small enterprises and self-employed persons and
one representative of a farmers' occupational organisation, as delegates
of employers' associations, as well as six representatives of the Belgian
General Federation of Labour, five representatives of the Confederation
of Christian Trade Unions and one representative of the Federation of Liberal
Trade Unions of Belgium as delegates of workers' associations.

	606.	The Government states that no seat has been attributed to the National
Federation of Independent Trade Unions (UNSI) because, in its view, this
organisation cannot at the present time be considered as one of the most
representative workers' organisations since, after examination of the documents
presented by the complainant organisation, the associations which comprise
it have a total of less than 100,000 members, a very large proportion of
whom is in the public sector.   Furthermore, it has not been shown that
the number of members belonging to the private sector justifies recognition
of the UNSI as a workers' organisation amongst the most representative
of the private sector:  some of the details concerning the number of affiliates
show only 28,430 members in the private sector and UNSI does not give any
information on the 23,485 members which it assigns to one of its component
organisations, the Cartel of Independent Unions of Belgium.   The request
for further details in this respect has remained unanswered.

	607.	The Government recalls that the 1952 legislation deliberately excluded
numerical criteria concerning the representativity of workers' organisations
so as not to limit the discretionary power of the Crown, as head of the
executive.   It therefore believes that there are no grounds for reference
to section 3 of the Act of 15 December 1968 concerning collective bargaining
and the committees which requires, in particular, that workers' organisations
comprise approximately 50,000 members.   This criterion, according to the
Government, is only an absolute minimum since the sphere of action of the
National Labour Council is necessarily much greater than that of a single
branch of activity.   It recalls that the number of affiliates is not the
only criterion which should guide the choice of the Government and that
according to the parliamentary proceedings of 1952, the legislation requires
that an organisation be stable for it to be recognised as representative,
so that it is in a position to ensure the respect of the agreements which
it signs.   According to the Government, since the National Union of Independent
Trade Unions was established only on 9 November 1982, it has not yet been
able to give proof of such stability.

	608.	As regards the consequences of non-participation in the National
Labour Council, the Government explains that in accordance
with the provisions
of the Act of 5 December 1968, the signing of a collective labour agreement
is reserved to the representative organisations.   These agreements have
a binding and direct effect on third parties.   This in no way means that
the other organisations may not conclude collective agreements but that
their effect will remain limited to only the contracting parties, in accordance
with the provisions of common law.

	609.	In the same way, the Government adds, the advantages which are accorded
under collective agreements to only unionised workers may not be considered
as contrary to freedom of association since they are much less than the
cost of union dues given the jurisprudential rules established, in particular,
by the Council of State.

	610.	The Government furthermore constantly ensures that the advantages
are related to the degree of representativity, as can be seen by the reform
which the Act of 22 January 1985 introduced as regards organisations which
can present candidates to the Electoral College of executive staff of the
works council.   Provision was made in this Act that in addition to the
occupational organisations of executive staff represented in the National
Labour Council, the specific organisations of executive staff with at least
10,000 members and the individual lists of executive staff supported by
10 per cent of the electors will be allowed to present candidates.   This
decision shows the concern of the Government to base the criteria of representativity
on real situations, excluding any type of discrimination.

	611.	As regards labour relations in the public sector, the Government
states that the Act of 19 December 1974 concerning relations between the
public authorities and the unions of employees coming under these authorities
was recently implemented by Royal Order dated 28 September 1984 in pursuance
of which certain changes were made to the labour relations system in the
public sector.

	612.	The Government admits that the UNSI is not at the present time affiliated
to a trade union organisation represented on the National Labour Council
and therefore cannot, for the time being, be considered as representative
to sit on the general bargaining committees (section 7 of the Act of 19
December 1974).   It adds that the UNSI may, however, under the provisions
of section 8, paragraph 1(2), and paragraph 2(2) of the 1974 Act and sections 53-65
of the Royal Decree of 28 September 1984 implementing this Act, be considered
as representative to sit on the sectoral committees and specific committees.

	613.	The Government points out that the UNSI has, to this end, and in
pursuance of section 53 of the Royal Decree of 28 September 1984, presented
its candidacy in letters dated 26 and 27 December 1984 to the competent
authorities, and that the latter immediately proceeded to verify whether
this organisation satisfied the conditions established by the law.   This
examination, carried out along with
that requested by other organisations
seeking admission, is currently under way.

	614.	As regards the approval arrangements contained in sections 15 and
16 of the Act of 19 December 1974 implemented by Royal Decree of 28 September
1984, the complainant organisation, like the other trade union organisations,
as early as 1 December 1984, requested and obtained its approval.   It
exercises the prerogatives conferred upon it by section 16 of the 1974
Act and letters of official recognition have been delivered to the trade
union leaders of UNSI.

	615.	As regards the trade union allowance, the Government explains that,
since the Act of 19 December 1974 was recently implemented by the Royal
Decree of 28 September 1984, the non-implementation of the Act of 19 December
1974 to which UNSI referred will no longer constitute an obstacle to the
comprehensive application of the Act on the trade union allowance.   Such
a comprehensive union allowance scheme presupposes, however, that the trade
union organisations considered as representative to sit on the sectoral
committees and the specific committees for which provision is made in this
Act should be determined beforehand by a membership count.   The results
of this count will be available only during the course of 1985.   It is
for this reason that the Act of 22 January 1985 extended the transitory
application of the Act respecting the trade union allowance for the reference
years 1983, 1984 and 1985;  this extension does not compromise the rights
of the UNSI.   If its representativity is established in 1985, it will
be able to benefit from the system of the trade union allowance from 1986.

	616.	As regards the representativity of the UNSI - in the public sector,
in the bargaining committees established by or under the Act of 19 December
1974 - an examination of this representativity is under way:  it was decided
on 13 May 1985, as regards the general bargaining committees (section 7
of the 1974 Act) that, since the complainant organisation is not affiliated
to a trade union organisation represented on the National Labour Council,
it is not considered as representative to sit on the general bargaining
committees and, as regards the sectoral committees (section 8 of the 1974
Act), that UNSI satisfies the requirements of representativity to present
its candidacy.

	617.	An examination of the criteria of representativity is thus now being
carried out by an independent commission enjoying autonomous decision-making
powers and composed of three judicial magistrates.   The purpose of this
examination is to verify whether the UNSI has a sufficient number of paid-up
members to be considered as representative to sit on the different sectoral
committees to which the complainant organisation has requested admission.
The results are expected before the end of 1985;  the work involves the
examination and comparison of staff lists and paid-up membership lists
of the trade union organisations.

	618.	In conclusion, the Belgian Government believes that it has satisfied
the request of the UNSI as regards the examination the conditions of representativity
and has done everything possible to ensure that this examination is carried
out in conditions which respect freedom of association, by entrusting the
examination to an autonomous commission composed of independent magistrates
and ensuring that the criteria established do not infringe the rights of
trade union organisations.

C.
The Committee's conclusions

	619.	This complaint, presented by a trade union federation organised at
the inter-occupational and national level and which claims to be representative,
concerns the difficulties it is encountering in its efforts to gain a seat
on the National Labour Council.   It also deals with the obstacles to its
normal functioning and the discriminatory treatment that results from its
inability to take part in the work of the Council.

	620.	At the Government's request, the Committee adjourned examination
of this case in November 1984 and in February and May 1985.

	621.	Before giving any opinion on the issues involved in this case, certain
aspects of which have already been raised in connection with a number of
similar cases brought before the Committee on Freedom of Association [69th
and 93rd Reports, Case No. 281 (Belgium);  92nd Report, Case No. 376 (Belgium);
130th, 143rd and 158th Reports, Case No. 655 (Belgium);  197th Report,
Case No. 918 (Belgium);  208th Report, Case No. 981 (Belgium)], the Committee
believes that they should be looked at in the framework of its past observations
on the question of trade union representativity.

	622.	In general terms, the Committee has recognised that certain advantages
might be accorded to trade unions by reason of the extent of their representativity,
but has taken the view that the intervention of the public authorities
with regard to advantages should not be of such a nature as to influence
unduly the choice of the workers in respect of the organisation to which
they wish to belong.   The Committee has also taken the view that the fact
that a trade union organisation is debarred from membership of joint committees
does not necessarily imply an infringement of the trade union rights of
that organisation, provided two conditions are met:  first, the reason
for which a union is debarred from participation in a joint committee must
lie in its non-representative character, determined by objective criteria;
second, in spite of such non-participation, the other rights which it
enjoys and the activities it can undertake in other fields must enable
it effectively "to further and defend the interests" of its members within
the meaning of Article 10 of the Freedom of Association and the Protection
of the
Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) [see 143rd Report, Case
No. 655 (Belgium), para. 40.]

	623.	Regarding the system resulting from the legislation in force in Belgium,
the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations
has for a number of years made comments on the provisions which require
occupational organisations to be represented on the National Labour Council
(on which only inter-occcupational organisations that are federated at
the national level may sit (Act of 29 May 1952)), in order to be considered
as representative, both in the private sector (Act of 5 December 1968)
and in the public sector (Act of 19 December 1974), so as to be able to
sit on joint committees in the private sector or take part in the work
of the general bargaining committees in the public sector.

	624.	Both the Committee of Experts and the Committee on Freedom of Association
[see 143rd Report, Case No. 655, para. 42] have considered that such legislation
might mean that even the most representative trade union in a particular
branch might be excluded from taking part in collective bargaining for
its sector.   Both have requested the Government to re-examine the above-mentioned
provisions of the Acts of 1968 and 1974 and to provide information on developments
in the matter.

	625.	In the present case, the complainant challenges the Government's
refusal to grant it access to the National Labour Council, which results
in it being unable to take part in trade union elections and in joint consultations
in the private sector, to pay employment allowances and to receive subsidies.
The organisation also complains of discriminatory treatment, which derives
from the fact that workers in the private sector are paid trade union allowances
which the complainant claims are too high and act as a real means of inducing
the workers to join unions that are close to the Government.   The complainant
also refers to the impossibility of taking part in the work of the general
bargaining committees in the public sector, following an amendment to the
Act of 19 December 1974 introduced by an Act of 19 July 1983, whereas previously,
according to the complainant, union organisations not represented on the
National Labour Council were debarred only from the highest committee.
The complainant criticises the discriminatory treatment that results
from the non-participation of the public sector union organisations in
the National Labour Council by virtue of sections 16 and 17 of the Act
of 19 December 1974 (concerning the holding of meetings, the collection
of union dues on departmental premises and the monitoring of examinations),
the alleged refusal of the three trade unions deemed by the public authorities
to be the most representative to accept a membership count whereas they
allegedly represent only 30 per cent of the staff in the public sector,
and the unilateral decision of the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications
which allegedly has led to the replacement of the representative Postal
Workers' Federation by a liberal union which is not representative.

	626.	Regarding the Government's alleged refusal to grant the complainant
organisation access to the National Labour Council when two seats on the
Council have been vacant since November 1980, the Committee notes the Government's
statement that the organisation's request was examined when the term of
office of the members of the Council was renewed in August 1985.   The
Committee regrets this delay since, as the Government admits, the complainant
organisation submitted its request during the first quarter of 1983.

	627.	As regards the representativity criteria laid down in Belgian legislation,
the Committee observes that according to section 2(2) of the Act of 29 May
1952, the Crown is empowered to appoint the members of the National Labour
Council selected from among the most representative inter-occupational
organisations federated at the national level.   The Committee also notes
that, in connection with Case No. 918, the Belgian Government cited among
the criteria of representativity other than those contained in the 1952
Act, section 3 of the Act of 5 December 1968, which reads as follows:

... The following shall be deemed to be representative workers' organisations
and representative employers' organisations:

(1)
Inter-occupational organisations of workers and employers established
at the national level and represented on the Central Economic Council and
the National Labour Council;  the workers' organisations shall furthermore
have at least 50,000 members ... [197th Report, para. 147.]

	628.	In the said case, the Committee considered that the minimum 50,000
members as a qualification for entitlement to sit on the National Labour
Council was not excessive, in so far as trade union organisations covered
all categories of workers and not a single category. [197th Report, Case
No. 918, para. 162.]

	629.	The Committee observes that the quantitative criterion of 50,000
members was not applied in the present case.   If this minimum had been
applied, the Committee would have considered that it was not excessive.

	630.	In the present case the Committee notes that the Government merely
points out that no seat was attributed to the UNSI because its member organisations
taken together have a total of less than 100,000 members, a large number
of whom belong to the public sector and it adds that the legislation stipulates
that an organisation, in order to be a member of the National Labour Council,
must be in a position to ensure the observance of the agreements which
it signs, and that in the view of the Government this is not the case as
regards the UNSI which was created only on 9 November 1982 and which has
not yet given proof of its stability.

	631.	The Committee also observes that six seats were allocated to the
Belgian General Federation of Labour, five to the Confederation of
Christian
Trade Unions and one to the Federation of Liberal Trade Unions of Belgium.

	632.	Since the refusal to grant a seat to the UNSI on the National Labour
Council makes it impossible for that union to sit on the general negotiating
committees for the public service, the Committee requests the Government
to indicate the objective elements which formed the basis for its refusal
to allocate a seat to the UNSI in order to enable the Committee to reach
a decision based on a full knowledge of the facts.

	633.	With regard to the obstacles to the normal functioning of the complainant
organisation as a result of its non-participation in the National Labour
Council, which it claims makes it impossible for it to take part in trade
union elections and joint consultation machinery, to pay unemployment allowances
and obtain subsidies, the Committee notes that in its reply of 24 September
1985, the Government states that whilst the collective labour agreement
under the Act of 5 December 1968 is reserved to representative organisations,
that is those represented on the National Labour Council, and has a binding
and direct effect with regard to third parties, this does not prevent the
other organisations from concluding collective agreements though these
will remain limited in effect to only their signatories.   The Government
does not provide any comments concerning trade union elections, the payment
of unemployment allowances and the obtaining of subsidies.

	634.	On this point, the Committee recalls that although it has recognised
that certain advantages, especially with regard to representation, might
be accorded to trade unions by reason of the extent of their representativity,
the reason for which a union is deprived of such advantages must lie in
its non-representative character.

	635.	As regards the alleged discrimination deriving from the fact that
workers in the private sector are paid union allowances which the complainant
organisation considers too high and claims are a real means of inducing
workers to join certain trade unions, since in many cases the allowance
is more than 50 per cent of union dues, the Committee observes that the
Government maintains that the principle and conditions underlying the granting
of the allowance in the private sector are matters for consultation and
negotiation between the parties and therefore are considered as trade union
security clauses.   The Government recognises that the public authorities
are involved but states that their role is confined to agreeing to register
a collective agreement and to render binding by Royal Order a collective
agreement reached by a joint body.

	636.	The Committee also notes the Government's explanations that the Royal
Orders making collective agreements binding and thereby securing advantages
for the members of certain trade unions are examined as to their legality
by the courts and that the said advantages must be proportional to the
contributions paid by the
unionised workers - that is to say that they
may not exceed the annual dues paid by members of their organisations.
The Committee also notes that in its reply of 24 September 1985, the
Government states that the advantages provided by collective agreements
to only the unionised workers are considerably below the cost of trade
union membership given the jurisprudential rules established by the Council
of State.   The Committee observes, however, that the effect of the system
of extension of the trade union security clauses contained in collective
agreements is to render them applicable to persons who have not participated
or who have not been represented in the process of negotiation.   The securing
of advantages thus takes on a different aspect in as much as it is no longer
applicable solely to the parties to a collective agreement.

	637.	Consequently, the Committee cannot but reiterate its earlier conclusions
and draw the Government's attention to the importance which it attaches
to the fact that any advantage granted by the law to workers who belong
to a particular trade union must not exceed a genuinely symbolic level,
so as to ensure that in no case can an advantage be of such a nature as
to influence unduly the workers' choice as regards the organisation to
which they intend to belong.   [See 92nd Report, Case No. 376 (Belgium),
para. 39, and 208th Report, Case No. 981 (Belgium), para. 117.]

	638.	The complainant claims that, in the public sector, the effect of
the Act of 19 July 1983 amending the Act of 19 December 1974 concerning
relations between the public authorities and trade unions of personnel
employed by these authorities is to deprive trade union organisations with
no seat on the National Labour Council of any possibility of participating
in the three general bargaining committees whereas, previously, they were
debarred only from the highest committee.   According to the complainant,
this Act ignores an opinion expressed in the past by the Committee of Freedom
of Association in connection with Case No. 655 in which the Committee had
criticised the Belgian system on the grounds that it might mean that sufficiently
representative organisations, and even the most representative organisation,
in the public sector might be excluded from the general bargaining committees
on the grounds that they were not affiliated to a trade union organisation
represented on the National Labour Council, a body which would not, however,
be competent with respect to the public sector.

	639.	The Committee notes the Government's explanation that the new Act
does not modify the situation obtaining under the 1974 Act since it is
intended solely to facilitate access to the general committees by removing
the requirement of a minimum number of members (10 per cent) for entitlement
to participate in them.   The Committee observes, nevertheless, that the
new Act maintains the requirement for an organisation to be affiliated
to an inter-occupational organisation represented on the National Labour
Council in order to be able to sit on both the Joint Committee for the
Public Services as a whole and on the national, provincial and local public
services committees (section 7, paragraph 3 of the 1974 Act, as amended
on 19 July
1983).   Furthermore, the Government in its reply of 24 September
1985, points out that the UNSI may not sit on the general bargaining committees
and that it may sit only on the sectoral and specific committees.

	640.	The Committee therefore considers that, even though in putting forward
its case the complainant may have been mistaken in indicating that, in
future, organisations not represented on the National Labour Council would
be debarred from the three general bargaining committees whereas in the
past they were debarred only from the highest committee, the fact remains
that the provisions of the Act of 19 December 1974, as amended by the Act
of 19 July 1983, and which came into force by virtue of the Royal Order
of 28 September 1984, do not meet all the criteria suggested by the Committee
with regard to trade union representativity.   The legislation still requires
an organisation to be affiliated to an inter-occupational organisation
represented on the National Labour Council in order to have a seat on the
Joint Committee for the Public Services as a whole and on the national,
provincial and local public services committees (section 7, paragraph 3,
of the 1974 Act as amended by the 1983 Act) and in order to be involved
in the collective bargaining procedure (section 6 of the 1974 Act).   The
amendment introduced by the Act of 19 July 1983 which removes the requirement
of the minimum number of 10 per cent does not alter the situation on which
the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations
has been making observations for several years.

	641.	The Committee, accordingly, invites the Government to amend its legislation
since it could result in public sector organisations - which do not sit
on the National Labour Council if they are not inter-occuptional or are
not affiliated to an inter-occupational organisation established at the
national level - being deprived of the right to bargain collectively in
defence of the occupational interests of their members in the general bargaining
committees, not only at the national but also provincial or local levels,
even though they might be sufficiently representative.   The new Act of
19 July 1983, as the Government itself recognises, actually grants organisations
not represented on the National Labour Council no new right.   It merely
confirms the right to which the organisations are entitled, namely, the
right to sit on specific or sectoral committees whose terms of reference
are restricted to issues affecting the staff of the services for which
they have been created, to the exclusion of issues that are the subject
of negotiations in one of the general national, provincial or local public
services committees or in the Joint Committee for the Public Services as
a whole (section 4(3) and section 8 of the 1974 Act).

	642.	Furthermore, the Committee notes with interest that the UNSI obtained
its approval by a decision of 1 December 1984 and that it has been authorised
to request a seat on the specific or sectoral bargaining committees by
a decision of 13 May 1985.   As regards this last point, the Committee
also notes with interest that the examination of the representativity of
trade union organisations which
seek to sit on the specific or sectoral
bargaining committees has been entrusted to an independent commission composed
of three judicial magistrates.   The Committee believes that this development
is positive.   It requests the Government to state whether in fact the
UNSI has been admitted to sit on the specific or sectoral committees and,
if this is the case, on which committees.   It would also like to know
the scope and compass of collective bargaining in the specific and sectoral
committees.

	643.	Regarding the alleged discrimination resulting from the non-participation
of the public sector trade union organisations in the National Labour Council
by virtue of sections 16 and 17 of the Act of 19 December 1974 (concerning
the holding of meetings, the collection of union dues on departmental premises
and monitoring of examinations), the Committee notes the Government's explanations
with respect to the prerogatives that are reserved for union organisations
deemed to be representative.

	644.	On this point, the Committee considers, however, that it can only
reiterate the conclusions it reached in its examination of the previous
allegation since the system established by the 1974 Act, as amended in
July 1983, might mean that sufficiently representative organisations, and
even the most representative organisation, in the public sector might be
denied the right to hold meetings and to collect union dues on departmental
premises not because they are unrepresentative but because they are not
representative within the meaning of the Act of 19 December 1974 as amended
- in other words, that they are not represented on the National Labour
Council.

	645.	Concerning the complainant organisation's challenge to the degree
of representativity of the three trade unions considered by the public
authorities as being the most representative and the alleged refusal of
these unions to agree to a membership count, the Committee notes the comments
of the Government on these various points.   In particular, it notes that
the Government challenges the figures given for the percentage paid in
the form of a trade union allowance, that it points out that the complainant
does not hold it responsible for the non-observance of the 1974 Act and
that it accuses the trade unions concerned of refusing a membership count.

	646.	The Committee considers that it is the responsibility of the Government
to conduct an objective verification of the representativity of occupational
organisations when this is challenged.   It recalls that occupational organisations
must be able to assert their right by means of a majority vote of the workers
or any other system of counting their members accepted by them and must
be able to demand a new election or recount of their membership after a
given period of time should they fail to demonstrate their representative
character.   It would appear from the Royal Order of 28 September 1984
to implement the 1974 Act that provision does exist for a membership count,
but that the verification of representativity takes place at the initiative
of the chairmen of the bargaining committees (sections 53 to 56).   The
supervision of the criteria of
representativity, on the other hand, lies
with a commission composed of judges (sections 58 to 70).

	647.	As to the representation of the post and telecommunications staff,
the Committee notes that appeals have been brought before the courts.
The Committee trusts that the principles concerning the verification of
the representativity of occupational organisations will be respected and
requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the appeals lodged
by the parties concerned.

The Committee's recommendations

	648.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following
conclusions:

(a)
Regarding the Government's alleged refusal to allow the complainant
organisation to sit on the National Labour Council, the Committee regrets
the Government's delay in taking up the matter.

(b)
The Committee observes that the refusal to grant a seat to the UNSI
on the National Labour Council makes it impossible for that union to sit
on the general negotiating committees for the public service;  the Committee
requests the Government to indicate the objective factors which form the
basis for the refusal to grant a seat to the UNSI on the National Labour
Council so that it can reach a decision on this aspect of the case in full
knowledge of the facts.

(c)
Regarding the alleged discrimination resulting from the payment to workers
in the private sector of trade union allowances that are said to be a real
means of inducing workers to become members of certain trade unions and
which are allegedly to be extended by a Royal Order, the Committee reminds
the Government of the importance that it attaches to the fact that any
advantage granted by the law to workers who belong to a particular trade
union must not exceed a genuinely symbolic level, so as to ensure that
in no case can an advantage be of such a nature as to influence unduly
the workers' choice as regards the organisation to which they intend to
belong.

(d)
Concerning the alleged discrimination resulting both in the public and
private sectors from the non-participation of union organisations in the
National Labour Council (impossibility of participating in union elections
and in joint consultations in the private sector and impossibility of taking
part in general bargaining committees and of holding meetings and collecting
union dues on departmental premises in the public sector), the Committee,
as has already the Committee of Experts on the
Application of Conventions
and Recommendations, requests the Government to amend its legislation.
This in effect provides that organisations that are not inter-occupational
in nature or which are not affiliated to an inter-occupational organisation
established at the national level do not sit on the National Labour Council.
As a result they are denied a considerable number of trade union rights,
including in part the right to bargain collectively in the economic sectors
in which they exercise their activities and in this particular instance
in general negotiating committees in the public sector.
(e)
Concerning the complainant organisation's challenge to the degree of
representativity of the three trade unions deemed by the public authorities
to be the most representative and the problem that has arisen in connection
with the representativity of the occupational organisations of post and
telecommunications staff, the Committee recalls that it is the responsibility
of the Government to conduct an objective verification of the occupational
organisations concerned and that the complainant occupational organisations
must be able to assert their right by means of a majority vote of the workers
or of any other system of counting their members accepted by them.   In
the present case, given that appeals have been brought before the courts,
the Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the
appeals lodged by the parties concerned.

(f)
The Committee notes with interest that the UNSI obtained its approval
by a decision of 1 December 1984 and that its request for authorisation
to sit on the specific or sectoral bargaining committees of the public
sector is currently being examined by an independent commission composed
of three judicial magistrates.

(g)
The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether in fact the
UNSI has been permitted to sit on some of these committees and, if this
is the case, on which committees and also to indicate the scope and compass
of collective bargaining in the specific and sectoral committees in question.

Case No. 1266

COMPLAINT PRESENTED BY THE NATIONAL UNION OF AFRICAN
TEACHERS OF UPPER VOLTA AND THE WORLD CONFEDERATION OF
ORGANISATIONS OF THE TEACHING PROFESSION
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF BURKINA FASO

	649.	The Committee examined this case at its November 1984 meeting, at
which it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report contained in
paragraphs 553 to 578 of its 236th Report, which the Governing Body approved
at its 228th (November 1984) Session.   Since
then, the World Confederation
of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP) supplied additional
information on this case on 28 March 1985, and the Government sent two
replies in letters dated 29 and 31 May 1985.   The WCOTP supplied certain
information in a communication dated 18 July 1985.

	650.	Burkina Faso has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection
of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
Previous examination of the case

	651.	This case refers to the arrest and detention in the internment camp
of Koudougou or in the gendarmerie of Ouagadougou of trade union leaders
Jean Pagnimda Bila, general secretary of the National Union of African
Teachers of Upper Volta (SNEAHV), Bahiéba Joachim Sib, secretary for external
relations, and Ismael Ousmane Kindo, deputy secretary of the union since
March 1984.   The case also involves the dismissal of a very large number
of teachers (2,600 according to the complainants) in March 1984, following
a 48-hour protest strike held by teachers on 20 and 21 March to obtain
the release of their imprisoned trade union leaders.   Lastly, it involves
the illegality, according to the complainants, of an extraordinary congress
of the SNEAHV held from 28 to 30 August 1984, during which an unlawful
trade union leadership was allegedly elected without the participation
of the striking teachers, but with that of two leaders of the national
executive of the said union who disassociated themselves from the protest
movement of 20 and 21 March 1984.

	652.	The Government had countered in its communications of March and June
1984 that the arrests of the union leaders had been motivated by political
rather than trade union activities.   As proof, it had sent a copy of the
motion of the SNEAHV of 7 August 1983 in which the union harshly criticised
the action of the Government which had itself, by proclamation of 4 August
1983, suspended political parties and prohibited political activities.
The Government accused the leadership of this union of being colonialist
and reactionary.   The Government had not replied to the allegation concerning
the extraordinary congress of the SNEAHV held in August 1984 during which,
alleged the complainants, an unlawful trade union leadership had been elected.

	653.	In these circumstances, at its Session of November 1984, the Governing
Body had approved the following conclusions of the Committee:

"(a)
With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee notes with grave
concern that four trade union leaders have been interned by the administrative
authorities for several months and that mass dismissals are said to have
involved
some 2,600 teachers for having taken part in a two-day strike.
(b)
The Committee urges the Government to release the trade union leaders
who have been interned by the administrative authorities without having
been judged or to ensure that they are brought rapidly before an independent
and impartial court and, in the latter case, to communicate the text of
the relevant judgements together with the reasons adduced therefor.
(c)
The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the situation
of these trade union leaders.
(d)
The Committee urges the Government to reinstate the teachers who were
dismissed only for having participated in a strike.
(e)
The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any measure
taken to this effect.
(f)
The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the
allegation to which it has not yet replied, and which dates from 1 October
1984, according to which, at an extraordinary congress of the SNEAHV in
August 1984, an illegal trade union executive was elected."

B.
Further allegations

	654.	According to the WCOTP, in its communication of 28 March 1985, the
SNEAHV trade union leaders Bila, Kindo and Sib, were still being detained
without having been tried.

	655.	The archives of the SNEAHV had been seized.

	656.	The Government had only reintegrated 100 teachers following the strike
of March 1984, out of approximately 2,600 persons who had been dismissed.
According to the WCOTP, the Government itself had permitted the dismissal
of 1,466 teachers.

	657.	The teachers had been made to undergo a political examination as
a condition of their reinstatement, as was shown by a photocopy of the
application form for readmittance in the public service of Burkina Faso,
attached to the documentation, which read in part as follows:
"I.  To be filled in by the dismissed teacher

	I, the undersigned,

	Name .............., Given name ............., Grade .......,

	Last post before dismissal .................................,

	Department .................., Province ....................,

	appeal to the mercy of the people of Burkina Faso for the revolutionary
penalty which I fully deserve for having participated in the pro-imperialist
and putschist  strike organised by elements manipulated by the stateless,
reactionary and counter-revolutionary former executive of the SNEAHV.

	Henceforth, I undertake to be guided by the political orientation speech
of 2 October and to be a devoted servant of the people of Burkina Faso
for the success of the great struggle which it has taken up since 4 August
1983 for freedom, dignity and social progress."

A second section, to be filled in by the Revolutionary Defence Committee
(CDR), indicated that the CDR, having noted that the person concerned participated
in the socio-economic activities, night meetings, individual debates and
general meetings of the Revolutionary Defence Committee, gave its consent
for the person concerned to join the revolutionary family of Burkina Faso.

	658.	The WCOTP also enclosed with its documentation a photocopy of a letter,
bearing the letterhead of the Minister of the Interior and Security, addressed
to dismissed teachers who were former members of the executive of the SNEAHV
(reference No. 3831/IS/CAB of 28 August 1984), in which the Director of
the Minister's Office pointed out to the persons concerned that, in accordance
with the statutory provisions, no person could carry on trade union activities
if he was not an active member of a duly recognised trade union.   The
letter added:  "Since your dismissal for holding a wildcat strike, you
have lost the status of teacher and therefore that of member of the teachers'
trade union.   I therefore draw your attention to everything which could
happen as a result of the illegal activities which you are currently carrying
on, contrary to your obligations and your new status."

	659.	The WCOTP also enclosed with its complaint a photocopy of a letter
addressed to the President of Burkina Faso by a group of teachers dismissed
on 23 January 1985, in which the persons concerned gave the assurance that
the two-day strike of 20 and 21 March 1984, of which the only purpose was
to request the release of trade union leaders, was not putschist in nature,
and requested the release of the union leaders detained in Koudougou and
in Ouagadougou and the reinstatement of primary school teachers and those
employed in training services for young agricultural workers who have been
dismissed for holding a strike.   The letter stated in particular that,
in view of the gravity of the situation, only the President could prevent
teachers from emigrating, restore the confidence of the dismissed teachers
(the letter mentioned that there had been several cases of suicide) and
revive the school system in Burkina Faso.   It was signed by the group's
appointed reporter, Daniel Ouedraogo.

	660.	Lastly, the documentation contained a photocopy of another letter
bearing the letterhead of a working group of dismissed teachers, dated
22 February 1985, also signed by the same Daniel Ouedraogo.   This group
appealed to the ILO to obtain the reinstatement of the dismissed teachers.
It pointed out that on 13 February 1985 only 100 teachers had been reinstated,
although the group had addressed the letter to the Chief of State to remind
him of the measure of clemency which he had decided to adopt in favour
of the dismissed teachers on the anniversary of his take-over on 4 August
1984.   The said measure of clemency, continued the letter, had not been
implemented although the dismissed teachers had been required to fill in
forms for this purpose.   The letter concluded that the teachers were destitute,
that it was prohibited for private establishments to engage them, that
the distribution of grain to the needy did not apply to them and that the
educational system in Burkina Faso was slowly dying.

	661.	The WCOTP concluded by requesting that an ILO mission visit Burkina
Faso.

C.
The Government's reply

	662.	In his communication of 29 May 1985, the Minister of Labour, Social
Security and the Public Service, in reply to the complainant's allegations,
pointed out that the case involved political demonstrations, concrete political
acts committed by politicians who had conducted political campaigns in
order to accede to political posts and the state apparatus.   These men
used trade unionism and the recruitment of public servants or employees
in a discriminatory way in order to betray the people.   They also resorted
to political agitation to stir up discontent and to incite a coup by their
elements in the army, continued the Minister.

	663.	The revolution of 4 August 1983 gave power to the people.   Its adversaries,
friends of the people in word only, had attempted to oppose the August
revolution, to spread crude lies, to denigrate it and to foment counter-revolutionary
conflicts and intrigues against the interest of the masses.   The August
revolution had dissolved the old reactionary political parties which had
divided the masses among themselves on a reactionary and regionalist political
basis.   The August revolution struggled against imperialism, neo-colonialism,
reactionary social forces, and reactionary classes and social groups which
were partisans of imperialist oppression and exploitation.   The
revolution,
which was the work of the masses, had been made in spite of the handful
of reactionaries who had seized political power or dreamed of seizing it,
the Minister further pointed out.

	664.	He added:  The former dignitaries of past regimes have been summoned
by the President of the National Council, who warned them against any manoeuvres
to oppose the status quo and sent them back to their village.   These former
leaders, who nurtured dreams of returning to the old order, wanted to conspire
with certain countries which were worried by the revolution of Burkina
Faso.   They were all gathered up and interned in several locations in
the country.   Some of them then called on their political friends in freedom
to continue the activities of sabotage, denigration and lies.   They were
the ones who thought they could cloak themselves in trade unionism and
brandish ILO Convention No. 87 to cover up their activities.

	665.	The Minister stated further:  The Government, which respects workers
and their organisations, cannot tolerate that, in their name, certain individuals
attempted to use trade unionism against the National Council of the Revolution.
Caught in the act of spreading poison and lies, these elements have been
captured and interned with the old leaders.   These measures were taken
against persons who lied deliberately in the hope of mobilising the people
in their struggle.   Anyone who still thinks that he can mobilise elements
of the people on the basis of lies, denigration and defamatory statements,
will meet the same fate, affirmed the Minister who requested the ILO and
the Committee on Freedom of Association to visit Burkina Faso to make an
investigation.

	666.	The Minister added:  It will be seen that the people, organised in
its democratic institutions, had to denounce the sordid manoeuvres of the
reactionary politicians in the SNEAHV leadership.

	667.	The Minister pointed out, however, that measures of release had been
taken with respect to certain political prisoners.   He gave an assurance
that the persons involved in this case could also be released with a warning
against failure to observe the existing provisions of legislation and regulations.
He affirmed that it was futile to infringe the law under the pretext
of holding trade union office and that the measure affecting the persons
involved was based on this argument.

	668.	The Minister further specified that the Government had received more
than 500 militant self-criticisms from teachers who condemned the political
and subversive machinations of the leaders of the SNEAHV.   He added that
in June 1984 he had thought that the ILO and the Committee on Freedom of
Association had been in possession of these self-criticisms, in which teachers
admitted that they have been manipulated by a leadership which had involved
them without their knowledge or by pressurising them in a political struggle
against the democratic popular revolution.

	669.	Lastly, the Minister observed that the SNEAHV no longer existed,
not that the Government had dissolved it administratively and contrary
to the provisions of Convention No. 87, but because this trade union organisation
had changed its name and leadership during its congress of August 1984.
At the end of this congress, it had been accepted that this trade union
would henceforth be called the National Trade Union of Teachers of Burkina
Faso (SNEB) and a new executive had been elected for this trade union.

	670.	Still according to the Minister, the SNEB and its members condemned
the acts committed by the former executive of the SNEAHV which, for political
reasons, had created a link between the teachers and the trade union and
certain politicians belonging to the reactionary parties.   Rank-and-file
members of the former SNEAHV had denounced the elements that had seized
leadership of their organisation and had changed the name of their organisation.
According to the Minister, the ILO should not accept the complaints by
administrators of trade union organisations which practice trade union
anarchy, denigration and defamation, hiding behind the shield of the ILO,
once the masses and their democratic defence organisations had risen up
to fight them.

	671.	In a further communication, dated 31 May 1985, the Minister of Labour
expressed surprise that complaints from a so-called working group, which
was in fact composed of counter-revolutionary individuals motivated by
putschist intentions, should be taken into consideration at the level of
an international body such as the ILO.   He affirmed that the allegations
of these individuals, who were overtly hostile to the democratic popular
revolution of 4 August 1983, only aimed to politically harm the National
Council of the Revolution and the prestige of the State, and he gave his
assurance that it had never been the intention of the National Council
of the Revolution to deliberately infringe trade union rights, as Burkina
Faso had ratified Conventions Nos. 87 and 98 in 1960 and 1962, respectively.

D.
Further developments

	672.	In a communication dated 18 July 1985, the WCOTP states that it has
been informed that two of the arrested trade unionists, Ismael Ousmane Kindo
and Bahiéba Joachim Sib, were released without being tried on 17 June 1985
after 16 months of detention.   The other trade unionists were thought
to be still administratively interned.

	673.	The ILO sent a telegram to the Government of Burkina Faso on 12 August
1985 requesting it to confirm the release on 17 June 1985 of the two trade
unionists referred to by name and to indicate whether other measures of
clemency had been adopted in favour of the two other trade union leaders
who were still detained and the numerous teachers dismissed following the
two-day strike of 20 and 21 March 1984.

E.
The Committee's conclusions

	674.	The allegations presented by the complainants in this case arise
out of the measures taken by the authorities against the National Union
of African Teachers of Upper Volta, following the accession to power of
the new Government of Burkina Faso on 4 August 1983.

	675.	According to the allegations, four trade union leaders had been arrested
in March 1984 without any charge being brought against them.   According
to the Government, on the other hand, the persons concerned were guilty
of pro-imperialist and putschist political manoeuvres and had used trade
unionism to cover up their activities of sabotage through denigration and
lies, in particular in their trade union motion of 7 August 1983.

	676.	Again according to the allegations, the national teachers' union
had held a 48-hour protest strike on 20 and 21 March 1984 in order to obtain
the release of its trade union leaders, which had led to the dismissal
of 2,600 teachers who had taken part in the strike and the subsequent reinstatement
of only 100 teachers who had been forced to undergo an examination of their
political views as a prerequisite for their reinstatement.   According
to the Government, on the other hand, 500 teachers have admitted in self-criticisms
addressed to the Government to having been manipulated by a trade union
executive which had involved them without their knowledge or by pressurising
them in a political struggle against the democratic popular revolution.

	677.	Lastly, according to the allegations, an unlawful trade union executive
had been elected in August 1984 without the participation of the striking
teachers but with that of two trade union leaders who had belonged to the
national executive of the said trade union and who had disassociated themselves
from the protest movement.   According to the Government, on the other
hand, the national teachers' union, at a congress held in August 1984,
had changed its name and leadership and its members had condemned the acts
committed by the former leadership who, for political reasons, had created
a link between themselves and their trade union and certain reactionary
politicians and parties.

	678.	As regards the internment of trade union leaders without any charge
having been brought against them, the Committee notes that the four trade
union leaders involved were arrested in March 1984 and that, according
to the complainants, two of them were released in June 1985 without having
been tried, after 16 months' detention, and the other two interned trade
union leaders are still in prison.

	679.	In this respect, the Committee, while noting that two interned trade
union leaders have been released, feels bound to express disapproval as
regards the imprisonment of these two leaders detained in an administrative
internment camp for 16 months, in
violation of the fundamental right of
trade unionists, as well as other persons, not to be arrested arbitrarily
and not to be kept in detention without having been found guilty by an
independent and impartial court.

	680.	The Committee observes with regret that the two other trade union
leaders, Jean Bila and Batiémoko Kome, are still being detained.   It urges
the Government, in view of the assurance provided in its reply as regards
the measures for the release of the persons involved in this case, to release
the persons concerned in the very near future.

	681.	As regards the measures of anti-trade union discrimination taken
against the striking teachers, consisting in dismissal and in the obligation
to sign declarations of loyalty in order to be reinstated, the Committee
reminds the Government that by ratifying Convention No. 98, Article 1 in
particular, it had undertaken to ensure that workers enjoy adequate protection
against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect  of their employment.
Likewise, by ratifying Convention No. 87, Articles 3 and 10 in particular,
it had undertaken to allow workers' organisations having the purpose of
promoting and defending the interests of their members the right to formulate
their programmes of action and to refrain from any intervention likely
to restrict this right or to impede the lawful exercise thereof.

	682.	In this case, not only has the Government dismissed a considerable
number of trade unionists in the teaching profession for having participated
in a peaceful two-day protest strike, but it has also compelled the strikers
to disassociate from their trade union leaders and to sign declarations
of loyalty to the Revolutionary Defence Committees.

	683.	The Committee recalls the importance it attaches to the right to
strike as a means to promote and defend workers' interests, and it again
urges the Government to reinstate all the teachers dismissed solely for
having participated in a peaceful strike and asks it to keep it informed
of any measure taken in this regard.

	684.	As regards the change of name and executive of the complainant national
trade union in this case, the Committee observes that the congress of teachers
of August 1984 undertook these changes without the participation of the
dismissed striking teachers.   It observes in addition that the Government
has prohibited striking teachers dismissed at the same time from carrying
on any trade union activity (see letter of the Director of the Office of
the Minister of the Interior of 28 August 1984).

	685.	In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the Government
has intervened in the internal affairs of this trade union, contrary to
the obligations arising out of Article 3, paragraph 2, of Convention No. 87.
It insists that the Government restore and guarantee both to the teachers
who took part in the strike who have
not been reinstated and to those who
were forced to sign declarations of loyalty the right to participate fully
in trade union activities for the defence of their economic and social
interests.

	686.	The Committee requests the Government to supply it with the record
of the extraordinary congress of the SNEAHV held in August 1984.

The Committee's recommendations

	687.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following
conclusions:

(a)
The Committee notes that two interned trade union leaders have been
released.   It feels bound, however, to express disapproval as regards
the imprisonment of these two trade union leaders who were detained for
16 months in an administrative internment camp in violation of the fundamental
right not to be arrested arbitrarily and not to be held in detention without
having been found guilty by an independent and impartial court.

(b)
The Committee again urges the Government to release the two other trade
union leaders who are still administratively interned without having been
tried, and asks it to communicate information on any measure taken in this
respect.

(c)
The Committee notes that 100 dismissed teachers out of over 2,600, according
to the complainants, have been reinstated after having been forced to sign
declarations of loyalty.   The Committee reminds the Government that it
is under an obligation to provide workers with adequate protection against
acts of anti-union discrimination and that it must abstain from any interference
in trade union affairs.

(d)
The Committee therefore again urges the Government to ensure that all
of the teachers dismissed solely for having participated in a peaceful
48-hour protest strike in March 1984 are reinstated, and asks it to keep
it informed of any measure taken in this respect.

(e)
The Committee urges the Government to restore and guarantee both to
the teachers who took part in the strike who have not been reinstated and
to those who were forced to sign declarations of loyalty the right to participate
fully in trade union activities for the defence of their economic and social
interests.

(f)
The Committee requests the Government to supply it with the record of
the extraordinary congress of the SNEAHV held in August 1984.
(g)
The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the
Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the failure to give practical
effect to Conventions Nos. 87 and 98 by Burkina Faso.

Case No. 1270

COMPLAINT PRESENTED BY THE JAOA MONLEVADE METALWORKERS' UNION,
THE UNITARIAN WORKERS' FEDERATION AND THE WORLD CONFEDERATION
OF LABOUR AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF BRAZIL

	688.	The Committee examined this case at its November 1984 meeting, when
it submitted an interim report which was approved by the Governing Body
(236th Report, paras. 603 to 622).   The Government sent certain partial
information on this case on 21 December 1984, and the complainants conveyed
additional information in communications of 6 December 1984 (JAOA Monlevade
Union) and 8 January 1985 (World Confederation of Labour).   The Committee
noted these developments in its 238th Report, paragraph 17, approved by
the Governing Body in February 1985.   Since then the Office has sent the
Government of Brazil two cables dated 25 April and 26 August 1985 requesting
it to reply to the allegations still pending.

	689.	Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection
of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), but has ratified the
Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
Previous examination of the case

	690.	The complaint originated in a labour dispute and strikes which developed
in 1983-84 in Belgo Mineira, an iron and steel undertaking in the State
of Minas Gerais, which led to dismissals of workers and trade union leaders,
requisitioning of strikers and the recruitment of workers from outside
the undertaking who were underpaid and forbidden to organise.   The complaint
referred in particular to the refusal of the management to renew the collective
agreement and to an attempt by the management to negotiate with unorganised
workers.

	691.	The Government sent certain information from which it transpired
that the regional labour delegation of the State of Minas Gerais and the
Secretary for Labour Relations had acted as mediators in the dispute.
The Government also stated, in general terms, that the right to organise
is guaranteed by Brazilian law.   On the other points mentioned above,
however, the Government did not communicate
concrete items of information
in reply to the allegations of the complainants.

	692.	At its November 1984 session the Governing Body therefore approved
the following recommendations of the Committee:

(a)
With respect to the allegations concerning the dismissal of workers
and trade union officials having taken part in a strike, the requisitioning
of strikers, the threats of dismissal against strike pickets and the recruitment
of workers at a lower wage accompanied by a ban to join a trade union in
order to break a strike, the Committee drew the Government's attention
to the dangers inherent in these alleged acts for freedom of association.
The Committee also considered that these acts restricted the legitimate
exercise of the right to strike.   It requested the Government to inform
it of measures taken or envisaged towards the reinstatement of the trade
unionists who had allegedly been unjustly dismissed and to ensure that
Brazilian legislation guaranteeing workers the basic right to join a trade
union should be respected.

(b)
Concerning the alleged refusal of the management to renew the collective
agreement which had expired in October 1983 and its attempts to negotiate
with workers not belonging to a trade union, the Committee recalled the
importance it attached to the promotion of collective bargaining with workers'
representatives and requested the Government to inform it of the reasons
for the employer's refusal to negotiate and also on the developments in
this labour dispute.

B.
The Government's reply

	693.	In its communication of 21 December 1984 the Government stated that
Brazilian law obliges the employer to negotiate with the appropriate trade
union (section 616 of the Consolidation of Labour Laws) and that, despite
seven meetings for conciliation purposes at the regional labour delegation
of the State of Minas Gerais, no solution had been found enabling the parties
to negotiate a new collective agreement;  this resulted in the institution
of legal proceedings in application of the labour legislation.   The Government
added that the proceedings were in progress before the labour court.
As regards the allegations of dismissal of trade  union officials, the
Government stated that Brazilian law protects such officials against acts
of anti-union discrimination and that, if individual complaints were made
and it were shown that trade union officials had been dismissed without
committing serious misdemeanours, the courts would order their reinstatement.
The Government accordingly requested the Committee on Freedom of Association
to declare the case closed.

C.
Further developments

	694.	In their communications of 6 December 1984 and 8 January 1985 the
complainants claimed that the Government had remained passive in the face
of the violations of freedom of association suffered by the workers of
JAOA Monlevade since, when the union asked the Ministry of Labour for the
inspection reports on the undertaking in July 1984, the Minister had allegedly
replied that he did not intend to take any measures against Belgo Mineira
and that, if the union wished to obtain copies of the inspection reports,
it would have to take legal action.   The complainants also took exception
to the fact that the Minister had allegedly not imposed any penalty on
the undertaking for persistent delays in the payment of wages, although
appeals had been lodged in this connection and Brazilian law empowered
him to penalise undertakings in such cases.

	695.	The complainants also repeated their statement to the effect that
even though, according to the Government, Brazilian law guarantees the
right to organise in the powerful multinational undertaking Belgo Mineira,
the management summons the workers individually to force them to sign a
letter prepared in advance in which they undertake not to join any trade
union on pain of dismissal.

	696.	The complainants also indicated that, although the undertaking is
under the obligation to check off trade union contributions from pay slips,
it refuses to do so.

	697.	The complainants also affirmed that a superintendent of the federal
police of the State of Minas Gerais was dismissed from office by the Minister
of Justice for having dared to impose sanctions on undertakings.

	698.	Finally, the complainants claimed that black lists containing the
names of workers who had stood up for their rights and had been dismissed
were being circulated among employers.   In particular, these lists bore
the names of about 100 wage earners who had refused to yield to pressure
by Belgo Mineira, had been dismissed and had been victimised when looking
for new jobs.

	699.	The complainants attached to their complaint a number of documents
in support of their allegations, including a letter of complaint addressed
to the regional labour delegate for Minas Gerais on 10 February 1984, in
which the complainant union explained that the Belgo Mineira undertaking
abolished the night shift unilaterally and without any consultation with
the union, obliging workers to work two shifts and not three and so depriving
them of the additional pay for night work which they had been receiving
for years and which they regarded as an integral part of their wages.

	700.	The documentation also contains two letters addressed to the Minister
of Labour by the complainant union, the first on 11 January 1984 requesting
copies of the labour inspection reports in the
undertaking concerned, the
second on 1 October 1984 reminding the Minister that, despite the interview
he had granted the union on 11 July 1984, no measure had yet been taken
to remedy the irregularities committed by the undertaking, in particular
the pressure exerted on workers to induce them to leave the union and renounce
the shift work supplement, which according to the union was a right acquired
many years ago, and to force them to refrain from involving the union in
the defence of their rights over the abolishment of their night work supplement
and the consequent reduction in their paid leave and supplementary social
benefits.   The letter also mentioned the refusal by the employer, in violation
of section 616 of the Consolidation of Labour Laws, to negotiate with the
union the renewal of the collective agreement which was to enter into force
on 1 October 1984.   The letter explained that the undertaking delegated
its bargaining powers to the employers' associations in the iron and steel
industry for the negotiation in its name of an agreement for this branch
of activity within a global bargaining framework including even small undertakings
employing three workers, whereas, according to the complainant union, the
undertaking had been negotiating directly with it for over 30 years.
Still according to the trade union, the employer wished to provoke a conflict
between the workers of small undertakings who were negotiating advantages
for the first time and those of Belgo Mineira, who already enjoyed acquired
rights and genuine advantages.   It also wished to destroy the image of
the trade union in the eyes of its members and to provoke clashes between
workers.   The letter ended by stating that, since the Minister of Labour
was aware of the unlawful acts of the undertaking, the union hoped that
he would take concrete steps to remedy the irregularities and again requested
the Minister to supply copies of the inspection reports.

	701.	The same complaints were transmitted by the complainant union to
the President of the Republic in a letter dated 11 October 1984, copy of
which was sent to the ILO by the World Confederation of Labour.

D.
The Committee's conclusions

	702.	In the present state of affairs the Committee deeply regrets that,
despite the time which has elapsed since the latest allegations were presented
by the complainants in December 1984 and the many requests for a reply
to the allegations addressed to it by the ILO, no written information has
been received from the Government respecting this labour dispute since
December 1984.

	703.	The Committee observes, however, that, according to the same written
reply furnished by the Government in December 1984, no solution was found
with a view to the renewal of the collective agreement in the Belgo Mineira
undertaking and that judicial proceedings had been instituted before the
labour courts in application of section 616 of the Consolidation of Labour
Laws.

	704.	The Committee notes that section 616, as amended by Act No. 4923
of 1965 and Legislative Decree No. 424 of 1969, provides that no industrial
association representing economic or occupational categories and no undertaking,
even if it is not represented by an industrial association, may refuse
to engage in collective bargaining, that in the event of a refusal to negotiate
the industrial associations and undertakings concerned must inform the
regional office of the Ministry of Labour so that a summons may be served
on the industrial association or undertaking refusing to bargain, and that,
in the event of persistent refusal to negotiate by ignoring the summons
served by the regional office of the Ministry of Labour or where the negotiations
fail, the industrial association or undertaking concerned may commence
a collective dispute.   Finally, where a collective agreement, collective
contract or binding award is in force, it is not permissible to commence
a collective dispute more than 70 days before its expiry and any new text
is to take effect from the date of such expiry.

	705.	In the present case the Committee has been informed neither by the
Government nor by the complainants of any settlement that may have been
reached in this dispute since December 1984, despite the many conciliation
meetings held at the regional labour delegation.   Nevertheless, the Committee
observes that Brazilian law imposes a time limit for the adoption of a
decision to commence a collective dispute in the event of refusal by an
employer to bargain.   In the present case, according to the Government's
own statements, judicial proceedings were instituted before December 1984
before the labour courts.   The Committee trusts that this labour dispute
has since been settled.

	706.	The Committee therefore requests the Government to communicate any
judicial decision handed down in respect of this labour dispute, and to
supply detailed information on the manner in which it has developed.

The Committee's recommendations

	707.	In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve the present interim report, and in particular the following
conclusions:

(a)
The Committee deeply regrets that, despite the time which has elapsed
since the complainants' latest allegations in December 1984 and the many
requests for a reply addressed to it by the ILO, no written information
has been received from the Government since December 1984.

(b)
The Committee requests the Government to communicate the text of any
judicial decision handed down in respect of the labour dispute between
the JAOA Monlevade Metalworkers' Union and the
iron and steel undertaking
Belgo Mineira, and to supply detailed information on the way in which this
dispute has developed.

Case No. 1294

COMPLAINT PRESENTED BY THE NATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF
AGRICULTURAL WORKERS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF BRAZIL

	708.	The complaint of the National Confederation of Agricultural Workers
(CONTAG) is contained in a communication dated 13 July 1984.

	709.	In the absence of observations from the Government the Committee
was obliged to adjourn examination of this case on three occasions, for
the last time at its May 1985 meeting, when it observed with regret that,
in spite of the time which had elapsed since the complaint was presented,
the information and observations awaited from the Government had not been
received.   The Committee therefore appealed to the Government to transmit
its observations as a matter of urgency, drawing its attention to the fact
that, in conformity with the procedural rules set out in paragraph 17 of
the Committee's 127th Report, approved by the Governing Body, it might
present a report at its next meeting on the substance of this case even
if the Government's observations had not been received by that date.
[See 239th Report, para. 15, approved by the Governing Body at its 230th
Session (May-June 1985).]   The Office has since sent the Government of
Brazil a cable, dated 27 August 1985, to remind it of this urgent appeal.

	710.	Since it has still not received the Government's information and
observations on this case, the Committee regrets that the Government has
not yet sent them, and in view of the time which has elapsed since the
complaint was presented, it feels obliged to examine the case without taking
these observations into account.

	711.	Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection
of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), but has ratified the
Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
The complainant's allegations

	712.	The National Confederation of Agricultural Workers (CONTAG) has submitted
a complaint of violation of freedom of association in Brazil on behalf
of the Federation of Agricultural Workers of the State of Pernambuco (FETAPE),
an organisation which is affiliated with it.   The complainants allege
that the employers resorted to violence
against militant workers in the
sugar-cane plantation area of the State of Pernambuco and that the government
authorities were ineffective in putting an end to it.

	713.	The complainants explain that in 1979, following a general strike,
the 240,000 rural workers of the above-mentioned sugar-cane cultivation
area had secured a collective agreement on wages and labour standards and
a guarantee that land would be made available to them for food crops.
From 1979 to 1983 other collective agreements were signed under the aegis
of the Regional Labour Court, and the workers became aware that they could
resort to the labour courts to secure observance of these agreements.
Parallel with these developments, the regional labour delegation was at
the same time maintaining systematic supervision of the region, in particular
keeping checks on clandestine labour and ensuring respect for the rights
of the workers enshrined in the law and collective labour agreements.

	714.	In the middle of 1982, however, the employers began to sabotage these
agreements by recruiting unemployed labour in the regions affected by the
drought which, at the time of the complaint, had been affecting the Sertao
and Agreste for five years.   They got rid of the regular workers, replacing
them by large numbers of underpaid, non-unionised clandestine workers from
these regions.   This involved no great risk to the employers, explain
the complainants, since the workers concerned returned to their administrative
districts after the harvest and had no means of upholding their rights
before a labour court.   The employers also hired temporary workers residing
in the administrative districts of the sugar-cane area, but they contrived
to employ them in districts far from their homes, so that the union in
their workplace was not that of which they were members and could therefore
not demand the application of collective agreements before the courts.

	715.	According to the complainants, these illegal manoeuvres by the employers
were facilitated by the inertia of the regional labour delegation, which
relaxed its supervision after the elections towards the end of 1982.

	716.	The complainants explain that, when the various press media gave
wide publicity to the campaign launched by the employers to recruit 55,000
workers from the semi-arid region for the 1983-84 harvest, the Rural Workers'
Union drew the attention of the Government of the State of Pernambuco to
the irresponsibility of the project from the social point of view and to
the benefits that it concealed for the employers, since it was obvious
that if workers were recruited from the semi-arid zone, this would be to
the detriment of the manpower traditionally available on the spot.   Its
sole aim was to exploit the agricultural workers of the Sertao and Agreste
to the maximum, and the union reminded the State Government of its duty
to find viable solutions to the problems of these workers in their home
areas.

	717.	Although the Secretary of State for Social Welfare of the Government
of the State of Pernambuco agreed, and stated his opposition to the employers'
project, saying that he would authorise it only if they were first able
to guarantee the full employment of the workers of the Meta area, no concrete
measures were taken to prevent the manoeuvres of the planters and refinery
owners.   On the contrary, administrative supervision was relaxed.

	718.	In order to evade responsibility for unjustified dismissals, the
employers then resorted to illegal or even brutal manoeuvres.   Not content
with reducing thousands of organised workers to unemployment, the employers
went to the lengths of denying them the payment of the indemnities to which
they were entitled by accusing them of leaving their employment or threatening
them with physical violence when they wanted to approach the labour courts
or their union.

	719.	The complainants also explain that, in order to secure the departure
en masse of the regular workers of the Meta zone, the employers suddenly
imposed a substantial increase in the workload, doubling or trebling the
volume of the daily tasks provided for in the collective agreements.
Parallel with this, they brought private armies on to the sugar-cane plantations,
composed of hired ruffians armed with revolvers and rifles, whose job it
was to "visit" the inhabitants and "supervise" payment of the workers.
At the same time, the workers who had been granted land for their own
use were no longer allowed to grow food crops on it;  their lands were
laid waste and transformed into cane-brakes.

	720.	At the same time the employers forbade the workers to mention the
trade union and the standards for the tasks stipulated in the collective
agreements and ceased deducting from the workers' wages the trade union
contributions the latter had authorised.   The private militia denied trade
union officials access to the plantations, and workers who attempted to
complain to the labour courts or who, like the union delegates, remained
in contact with their unions, were subjected to exemplary punishment by
the militia:  they were beaten up or shot in the middle of the night, and
threats and even murders were common.

	721.	This was the climate of intimidation and terror that developed in
a number of plantations, in particular at Caraúbas, in the Paudalho administrative
district, for which Geraldo Guerra had held the concession since 1983.
In this connection, the complainants mention the inspection report of
the regional labour delegation for this plantation, dated 7 November 1983.

	722.	According to this report, out of a payroll of 140 workers, 40 were
clandestine workers receiving a wage lower than that stipulated in the
collective agreement.   The report noted that the workload for sugar-cane
strippers had doubled (from 80 to 144 bundles), that only 20 of the 100
regular workers were receiving six days' wages and remuneration for the
weekly rest day, whereas the remaining 80 were receiving less than six
days' wages and no
remuneration for the weekly rest as a result of the
doubling of the workload.   Finally, the employer, his steward and the
four men accompanying them were armed with rifles and revolvers, according
to the inspection report.

	723.	In addition, say the complainants, a 72-year-old agricultural worker
on the same plantation, António Rodriguez dos Santos, who had been living
on the estate for over 40 years and had refused to leave his home and his
plot of land, was shot dead by a plantation supervisor on 10 January 1984.
The first official version of the affair spoke of a crime of passion,
a later version of an accident with a firearm.   As it happened, the victim
was related to the President of the Union of Rural Workers of Sao Lourenço
da Mata and of the President of the Union of Rural Workers of Paudalho.

	724.	On this plantation, according to the complainants, the employer no
longer deducts the workers' trade union contributions, giving as a pretext
the need for "free and spontaneous communication".   Some workers complained
to the Limoeira Court and 18 of them told the court that they had signed
their request for cancellation of the check-off under pressure.   Following
the murder of Rodriguez dos Santos, about 40 workers appeared before the
same court, accompanied by the employer, Geraldo Guerra, and confirmed
that they had signed the request for cancellation on their own initiative,
after which the workers who had complained to the Paudalho police were
taken by the employer, Geraldo Guerra, to the same police station to withdraw
their complaint "spontaneously".

	725.	Finally, still on the same plantation, controllers of the Institute
of Weights and Measures who were making a visit were forced at gunpoint
to return the scales and gauges which they had seized on the suspicion
that they had been tampered with.

	726.	Similar manoeuvres are also reported from other plantations, including
Taquarinha in the administrative district of Maraial, where José Ribeiro
da Silva holds the concession and where, on 19 March 1983, an attempt was
made on the life of the agricultural worker António Pedro da Silva by the
employer's son-in-law, one Renato de Tal, because he had complained to
his union, which is a member of the Federation of Agricultural Workers
of the State of Pernambuco (FETAPE) about the invasion of his plot of land
and the damage done to it.

	727.	Likewise, at Jacunde, in the administrative district of Ferreiros,
on the plantation conceded to José Barbosa Pereira, an attempt was made
on the life of the agricultural worker José Francelino Gomes on 17 March
1983 by the employer, who fired four shots at his house while he and his
family were in it.   The victim was forced to abandon the harvest of his
2-hectare plot and to change plantation, thus losing his rights to 17 days'
paid leave and his severance pay.

	728.	Finally, at Araújo, in the administrative district of Sao Lourenço
da Mata, on the Bulhoes concession, the union delegate was
threatened on
2 February 1984 by the plantation supervisor who, revolver in hand, set
fire to the premises of the union delegation, totally destroying its roof,
in order to prevent the workers from meeting there.

	729.	The complainants consider that impunity encourages violence.   They
denounce the escalation of this violence which, they say, is particularly
affecting the administrative districts of Carpina, Lagoa, Itaenga and Paudalho,
and the fact that the federal inspectors of the Ministry of Labour and
controllers of weights and measures have been prevented at gunpoint from
carrying out their tasks.

	730.	They object to the unofficial power of the employers, who use force
to back up their claims to flout the law and make attempts on the physical
integrity and the lives of the workers, attacking the right to organise
guaranteed by the Constitution and making a mockery of the federal supervisory
institutions and the labour courts.

	731.	The complainants add that, on 20 May 1983, they went to see the Governor
of the State of Pernambuco to hand him a document denouncing the violence
in the Meta area and demanding the adoption of measures to punish the guilty
parties.   The Governor stated that it was necessary to ensure respect
for law and order, and the FETAPE communicated to its council of representatives
consisting of 152 unions the assurances it had received in this connection.
However, FETAPE and CONTAG observe with regret the inefficacy of the
police investigations conducted since that time, given the bias of the
investigators who interpret cases of violence as disputes between workers.

	732.	In conclusion, the complainants demand that the private militias
should be disarmed;  that the police investigations should be placed in
the hands of delegates capable of elucidating the facts in order to establish
responsibilities and punish the guilty parties;  that the Government should
take a clear and unequivocal stand on respect for the rights of the rural
workers of the sugar-cane growing area of Pernambuco, and in particular
that the regional labour delegation should exercise systematic supervision
accompanied by penalties;  that the Sugar and Alcohol Institute should
supervise the observance of the law respecting plots of land (Decree No. 57.020);
and that the federal highway police and the Transport Department should
supervise the observance of the highway code.

B.
The Committee's conclusions

	733.	The Committee recalls that at its May-June 1985 Session the Governing
Body advised the Government that, in conformity with its procedure, it
might present a report on the substance of the case at its next meeting
even if the Government's observations had not been received.   The Committee
has still not received these observations.

	734.	In these circumstances, and before examining the substance of the
case, the Committee feels it necessary to recall the considerations set
forth in its First Report (paragraph 31) which it has had cause to repeat
on a number of occasions:  the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote
respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is
confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations,
governments on their side will recognise the importance of formulating
for objective examination detailed factual replies to such factual charges
as may be put forward.

	735.	The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not sent a reply;
because of the time which has elapsed it is obliged to examine the case
without taking account of the Government's observations.

	736.	The Committee observes that this case concerns acts of violence committed
by sugar-cane plantation employers in the Meta region of the State of Pernambuco
against workers who are only seeking the application of collective labour
agreements.   In particular, it notes the prohibition by these employers
of access by trade union officials to plantations, the obstacles placed
in the way of trade union activities, the burning of trade union premises,
the stoppage of check-offs of trade union contributions demanded in advance
by the workers, threats to kill rural workers and relatives of trade union
officials which are sometimes even put into practice, and finally acts
committed by certain planters against representatives of the public authorities
carrying out inspections in these areas.

	737.	It appears from the information furnished by the complainants that
the authorities exercised systematic supervision in these areas until the
end of 1982, but that since then, despite the good will of the Governor
of Pernambuco, certain planters have been behaving in a violent and illegal
manner and are no longer subjected to penalties, since according to police
investigations on the plantations such acts are allegedly due to disputes
between workers.

	738.	Given the extreme seriousness of the allegations, which mention reprisals
against workers in the sugar-cane plantations of the Pernambuco region
who are simply demanding respect for the rights obtained in collective
agreements, the Committee must recall the importance it attaches to the
unimpeded exercise of trade union activities.

	739.	It accordingly urges the Government to take all necessary measures
to guarantee a climate favourable to the exercise of trade union rights
by the workers in this area and also requests it to indicate what measures
have been taken to restore the trade union situation to normal and secure
respect for collective agreements on these plantations.

The Committee's recommendations

	740.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve the present interim report, and in particular the following
conclusions:

(a)
The Committee deeply regrets that, despite the many requests addressed
to it, the Government has sent no written information on this complaint
presented by the National Confederation of Agricultural Workers of Brazil
in July 1984.

(b)
It draws the Government's attention to the fact that the purpose of
the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law
and in fact, and that the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments
against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognise
the importance of formulating for objective examination detailed factual
replies to such factual charges as may be put forward.

(c)
Regarding the substance of the case, given the extreme seriousness of
the allegations, which mention reprisals against sugar-cane plantation
workers in the Pernambuco area who are simply demanding respect for the
rights obtained in collective agreements, reprisals which include forbidding
trade union officials access to plantations, obstacles placed in the way
of trade union activities, burning of trade union premises, the stoppage
of check-offs of trade union contributions and threats to kill persons
connected with trade union officials which are sometimes put into practice,
the Committee must recall the importance it attaches to the unimpeded exercise
of trade union activities.

(d)
The Committee accordingly urges the Government to take all necessary
measures to guarantee a climate favourable to the exercise of trade union
rights by the workers in this area and also requests it to indicate what
measures it has taken to restore the trade union situation to normal and
secure respect for collective agreements on these plantations.

Case No. 1307

COMPLAINT PRESENTED BY THE WORLD FEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF HONDURAS

	741.	The Committee examined this case at its February 1985 meeting when
it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body [see 238th Report,
paras. 312 to 329, approved by the Governing Body at its
229th Session
(February-March 1985)].   Subsequently, the Government submitted its observations
in a communication dated 29 April 1985.

	742.	Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of
the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
Previous examination of the case

	743.	When the Committee examined the case at its February 1985 meeting,
two questions remained unresolved.   The first of these concerned a decision
taken by the judicial authority to suspend the legal personality of the
National Power and Electricity Undertaking trade union for six months as
a result of the strike held on 19 September 1984.   The Committee requested
the Government to provide information on this matter.

	744.	The second question remaining unresolved concerned the disappearance
of the trade union leader, Gustavo Morales.   The Committee requested the
Government to communicate the results of the investigation being carried
out by the authorities as a matter of urgency.

B.
The Government's reply

	745.	In its communication of 29 April 1985, the Government states that
the decision taken by the judicial authority to suspend for six months
the legal personality of the trade union of the National Power and Electricity
Undertaking was appealed against in the Labour Appeals Court.   The Government
communicates the decision of the Appeals Court, dated 26 October 1984,
revoking the judicial decision of the tribunal of first instance and reducing
the period of suspension of legal personality from six to two months.
Consequently, the legal personality of the above-mentioned trade union
was restored on 21 November 1984.

	746.	Regarding the disappearance of the trade union leader, Gustavo Morales,
the Government expressed its concern at the situation and stated that it
would be in touch with the relevant authority for information on the investigations
into the matter.

C.
The Committee's conclusions

	747.	The Committee notes the decision of the Labour Appeals Court of 26
October 1984, whereby the period of suspension of the legal personality
of the trade union of the National Power and Electricity Undertaking was
reduced from six to two months.   Considering that, as a result of this
decision, legal personality was restored to this trade union on 21 November
1984, and that the Committee concluded at its February 1985 meeting that
the declaration of illegality of the strike held on 17 September 1984 in
the National Power and Electricity Undertaking did not infringe the principles
of freedom of association because the undertaking in question was providing
an essential service in the strict sense of the term [see 238th Report,
para. 326], the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not
call for further examination.

	748.	With respect to the disappearance of the trade union leader, Gustavo
Morales, the Committee regrets not having received information on the outcome
of the investigation into this matter, and requests the Government to communicate
the results of this investigation.   The Committee expresses the hope that
the direct contacts mission accepted by the Government, and scheduled for
January 1986, will be able to obtain information and discuss this question
with the authorities.

The Committee's recommendations

	749.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following
conclusions:

(a)
the Committee considers that the allegation concerning the suspension
of the legal personality of the National Power and Electricity Undertaking
trade union does not call for further examination;

(b)
regarding the disappearance of the trade union leader, Gustavo Morales,
the Committee regrets not having received information on the outcome of
the investigations into this matter and requests the Government to communicate
the results of these investigations;

(c)
the Committee expresses the hope that the direct contacts mission accepted
by the Government and scheduled for January 1986, will be able to obtain
information and discuss this matter with the authorities.

Case No. 1309

COMPLAINTS PRESENTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF
FREE TRADE UNIONS, THE WORLD CONFEDERATION OF LABOUR,
THE WORLD FEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS AND OTHER TRADE
UNION ORGANISATIONS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF CHILE

	750.	The Committee examined this case at its February and May 1985 meetings,
when it presented interim reports to the Governing Body.   [See 238th Report,
paras. 330 to 364 and 239th Report, paras. 298 to 340, approved respectively
by the Governing Body at its 229th and 230th Sessions (February-March and
May 1985).]

	751.	Since then, the ILO has received the following communications from
the complainants:  International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU):
22 May 1985, 4 and 31 July 1985, 9 and 22 August 1985, 9, 24, 25 and 27 September
and 7 October 1985;  National Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions in
Building, Wood, Building Materials and Related Activities:  15 May 1985;
National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body (CNS):  23 May 1985;  World Confederation
of Organisations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP):  30 May, 1 and 15
October 1985;  the National Grouping of Workers:  3 June 1985;  the World

Government, for its part, furnished its observations in communications
dated 8, 15 and 29 August, 11 September and 16 October 1985.

	752.	Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection
of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) nor the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
Previous examination of the case

	753.	The complaints presented in the present case concerned a number of
events that had taken place in Chile since September 1984.   The allegations
referred to the intervention of the forces of order on the occasion of
the Protest Day held on 4 September 1984, which is said to have resulted
in the death of ten persons, many injuries and over 1,000 arrests.   The
complainants referred in particular to the case of Juan Antonio Aguirre
Ballesteros, who, they said, had been arrested and tortured and whose body
had been subsequently found.   In this connection, the Government indicated
that inquiries were being carried out by the competent criminal courts.

	754.	It appeared, in the light of the allegations made, that the headquarters
of certain trade union organisations (in particular the Confederation of
Building Workers, the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH)
and the Chilectra trade union) had been attacked by the police and that
material had been destroyed, documentation confiscated and trade unionists
arrested.   The Government denied that it had given orders for the trade
union premises in question to be searched.   Furthermore, on the day following
the attack on the AGECH premises, Messrs. Manuel Guerrero, President of
the metropolitan sector of this organisation and José Manuel Parada, an
official of the Vicariat of Solidarity, were kidnapped in the street.
Their bodies were subsequently found horribly mutilated.   The Government
stated that a judicial inquiry had been opened.

	755.	The complainants also referred to numerous arrests and the banishment
of trade unionists.   According to the Government, some of these trade
unionists had not been arrested, others had been released and the reasons
for the banishments were not related to trade union activities.

	756.	Finally, the Committee was informed of allegations concerning infringements
of the exercise of the right to hold meetings, in particular taken against
a works union of the National Copper Corporation.   The Government had
not replied to this allegation.

	757.	At its meeting of May-June 1985, the Governing Body approved the
following conclusions of the Committee:

(a)
The Committee expresses its deep concern at the difficulties facing
a large number of Chilean trade union organisations and their leaders.
It considers that the Government should urgently take every measure necessary
to put an end to this climate of violence;  this implies that respect for
the human rights essential for the development of trade union activities
be guaranteed.

(b)
As regards the deaths which took place during the National Protest Day
of 4 September 1984, the Committee requests the Government to supply information
on developments in the inquiry opened into this matter and on its eventual
results.

(c)
As regards the death of Messrs. Aguirre, Guerrero and Parada, the Committee
expresses the firm hope that the inquiries under way in these matters will
lead to the rapid determination of responsibilities;  it requests the Government
to continue to supply information on these inquiries.

(d)
As regards the attacks on trade union premises, the Committee deplores
the fact that such acts have again been committed against trade union organisations.
It notes that the Government denies having ordered searches of these
premises and requests the
Government to order that inquiries be undertaken
with a view to finding the perpetrators of these acts which call for severe
measures by the authorities against those found responsible.   It requests
the Government to supply information on any inquiries which have been carried
out in this regard.
(e)
As regards the arrest and banishment of trade unionists, the Committee
notes the information supplied by the Government, in particular, that some
persons were not arrested and that others are free.   It considers that
the accumulation of these banishment measures considerably weakens trade
union organisations by depriving them of their leaders and hindering their
activities.   It requests the Government to supply information on the situation
of the persons - listed in the Annex - concerning whom it has not yet replied
and on the concrete acts which were the basis for the measures taken against
them.

(f)
As regards the obstacles to the right of assembly, the Committee notes
with regret that the Government has not lifted them.   It requests the
Government to supply its observations on the allegations presented by the
Works Union No. 6 of the National Copper Corporation.

B.
New allegations

	758.	In its communication of 22 May 1985, the ICFTU refers to a letter
which was sent to it on 7 May 1985 by the Confederation of Copper Workers.
The latter organisation alleges that on 27 April 1985, the homes of several
of the leaders of the El Salvador trade union were searched in Diego de
Amalgro when these persons were attending the National Congress of the
Confederation.

	759.	On 1 May 1985, a leader of the same trade union was summoned to the
carabineers' headquarters of El Salvador.   On the same day, several leaders
of the Andean zone trade union were arrested and held for several hours
for having organised an athletics competition in the streets of Villa Minera
Andina to celebrate the 1st of May, despite the fact that they had been
granted authorisation to hold the event.

	760.	On 3 May 1985, Mr. Raúl Montecinos, leader of the Diego de Amalgro
zone and national leader of the Confederation, was allegedly arrested and
then transferred to the town of Copiapó.

	761.	The National Confederation of Worker' Trade Unions in Building, Wood,
Building Materials and Related Activities and the National Grouping of
Workers allege, in their communications of 15 May and 3 June 1985, that
on 9 April 1985 the headquarters of the Building Confederation of Building
Workers were illegally searched by a group of ten individuals armed with
machine guns and whose faces were covered with balaclavas.   This search,
which was carried out without
any legal warrant, involved the use of violence.
The trade union leaders present were harassed, attacked and beaten.
Furniture was broken and property taken away, including training materials
and the archives of the Confederation.   Several trade union leaders were
threatened with death if they continued to exercise their activities.

	762.	Shortly later the same day, the complainant organisation alleges
that officials of the carabineers appeared at the headquarters of the Confederation
and interrogated the trade union leaders Figueroa Jorquera, Bustamante
Garci and Alvarez, who were then taken to the police station and once again
interrogated.

	763.	Furthermore, according to the complainant organisation, during the
months of March, April and May 1985, several of its leaders were frequently
followed, threatened or harassed.   Since 9 April, carabineers have been
controlling the entrance to the trade union headquarters and sometimes
prevent trade union leaders and members from entering.

	764.	Given these circumstances, the Confederation lodged complaints and
appeals for protection with the courts.   It appears from these court proceedings
that the staff of the National Information Centre, the carabineers of Chile
and the civil investigation department of the police did not participate
in the search carried out in the premises of the Confederation and that
no warrant had been issued for the arrest of trade union leaders.

	765.	The complainant organisation adds that on 15 April 1985, the Minister
of the Interior brought legal proceedings against four of its leaders,
namely, Sergio Troncoso, José E. Rivera, José Manuel Bustamante and José
Figueroa, for having violated the State Security Act, and in support of
the case presented the documentation which had been seized during the paramilitary
operation of 9 April carried out against the trade union headquarters.
According to the complainant organisation, the links between the authorities
and the group in question are thus clearly proven.

	766.	In its communication of 23 May 1985, the CNS mentions the banishment
of several trade union leaders (see Annex), some of whom have been allegedly
interned in a camp, at Conchi, in the north of the country.

	767.	The WCOTP also mentions, in its communication of 30 May 1985, several
instances of the banishment of trade unionists in the teaching profession
(whose names had already been communicated to the Committee), as well as
the dismissal of several members and leaders of the Professional Association
of Teachers of Chile (AGECH):  Alban Mancilla, Orlando Aguilar, Luis Maldonado,
Carlos Trujillo, Nelson Torres, all of whom are leaders or former leaders
of the Castro Community Council, as well as Juan Ruiz, President of the
Provincial Council of Puerto Montt.

	768.	In its communication of 4 July 1985, the ICFTU mentions the situation
of Siergo Aguirre, President of the Union of Port Workers of San Antonio,
who was dismissed from the civil service by a Supreme Decree after he had
been banished.

	769.	The ICFTU also refers to the proceedings brought against four leaders
of the Confederation of Building Workers.   During the proceedings, Manuel
Bustos, President of the CNS, was called upon to give evidence and, during
the interrogation by the examining magistrate, the latter ordered his arrest.
He was taken to the former public prison and locked up in a cell without
any light.   For three days he was given no water or food.   He was released
following the unanimous decision of the Eighth Chamber of the Court of
Appeal.   Three days after the release of Manuel Bustos, the four leaders
of the Confederation of Building Workers were released on bail.

	770.	The National Grouping of Workers and the WCL also mention, in their
communications of 3 and 5 June 1985, the arrest of Manuel Bustos.

	771.	In its communication of 8 July 1985, the WFTU refers to the case
of Pedro Aroya Díaz Valdez, President of the Union of Professional and
Technical Pilots, who was dismissed in 1984 because of his trade union
activities.   Furthermore, his organisation has been virtually destroyed.
All his attempts to be reinstated in his work have been unsuccessful.

	772.	Works Unions Nos. 1 and 6 of El Salvador and No. 8 of Sewell y Minas
of the National Copper Corporation as well as the ICFTU, in their communications
of 31 July 1985, refer to the dismissal of Rodolfo Seguel, President of
the National Copper Confederation.   This measure was endorsed by the Supreme
Court following an appeal presented by Mr. Seguel.   According to the complainants,
the effective inexistence of any protection of trade union leaders prevents
the exercise of trade union mandates and jeopardises the autonomy of the
trade union movement.   Subsequently, the WFTU and the ICFTU sent, in their
communications of 21 and 22 August 1985, the text of the judgement issued
by the Supreme Court in this matter.

	773.	In their communications dated 8 and 9 August 1985, the WFTU and the
ICFTU protest against the arrest of trade union leaders including Sergio
Troncoso, President of the Confederation of Building Workers, and Juan
Ponce who were subsequently banished to Melinka in the far south of the
country.

	774.	The ICFTU points out, in its telegram of 9 September 1985, that a
demonstration which had been called by the National Grouping of Workers
(CNT) on 4 September 1984 was violently repressed.   According to the ICFTU,
ten persons were killed and hundreds were arrested.   Charges were brought
against several leaders of the CNT and, in particular, against Rodolfo
Seguel, Manuel Bustos, José Ruiz di Giorgio and Sergio Troncoso.   Subsequently,
in communications dated 24 and 27 September and 3 October 1985, the ICFTU
and the WCL point
out that following a decision by three judges of the
Supreme Court, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Rodolfo Seguel and
Manuel Bustos who were imprisoned.   José Ruiz di Giorgio, President of
the Union of Petroleum Workers, Maria Rozas and Mercedes Jerez, leaders
of the Professional Association of Teachers of Chile (AGECH), have also
been arrested.   The Trade Unions International of Workers in the Metal
Industry also mentions the arrest and banishment of Claudio Gallardo, leader
of the Confederation of Unions of Metallurgical Workers (CONSTRAMET).
The WCOTP, for its part, alleges in its communication of 1 October 1985
that four national leaders of the AGECH were arrested on 30 September.
They are Jorge Paveg, President;  Samuel Bello, Treasurer;  Luis Campo
Leal and Carlos Poblete Avile, members of the National Executive Committee.

	775.	In its communication of 25 September 1985 the ICFTU supplies further
details concerning the measures taken by the authorities following the
demonstration of 4 September.   According to the ICFTU, the purpose of
this demonstration was to demand a reply from the Government to the "list
of petitions and claims" of the workers adopted in August by the National
Assembly of Leaders of the National Grouping of Workers.   The Government
allegedly responded to this Day of Protest by the arrest of 87 leaders
of student, trade union and political organisations, including 13 leaders
of the National Grouping of Workers and 17 leaders of the Professional
Association of Teachers of Chile.  Furthermore, 63 other persons were allegedly
held in administrative detention for a period of 20 days.   In the same
way, more than 500 persons were allegedly arrested throughout the country
during demonstrations.   They were brought before the local police courts
and  accused of having instigated acts of disorder on the public thoroughfare.

	776.	In its communication of 7 October 1985, the ICFTU states that Manuel
Bustos, Rodolfo Seguel and José Ruiz di Giorgio are still being held in
detention.   Seven other trade union leaders have allegedly been arrested
and taken to Santiago prison (see Annex).   The WCOTP refers in its communication
of 15 October 1985 to the arrest of four AGECH leaders and states that,
according to the organisers of the 4 September demonstration, acts of provocation
had occurred.   According to the WCOTP, it was observed that occupants
of an unmarked car fired shots which apparently caused deaths and injuries.

C.
Replies of the Government

	777.	Before replying to the specific allegations made in the present case,
the Government, in its communication of 11 September 1985, makes some general
comments on freedom of association in Chile.   It mentions, in particular,
the current provisions regarding the acquisition of legal personality,
the drafting of constitutions, the right to elect leaders, dissolution
through the courts, the establishment of federations and confederations,
affiliation to
international organisations, trade union law and employment
as well as trade union autonomy.   After an examination of these various
provisions, the Government concludes that in its view the national legislation
embodies a strict application of the provisions of Conventions Nos. 87
and 98, although these instruments have not been ratified by Chile.

	778.	As regards civil liberties, the Government points out that although
it believes that the political situation of the country goes beyond the
subjects which should be dealt with by the Committee of Freedom of Association,
the political Constitution of the Republic was adopted in 1980 by 67 per
cent of the voters and that it establishes, after a period of transition,
the full respect of the democratic system.   The Government adds that because
of experiences which have occurred in the country and the escalation in
terrorism, which is affecting all the peoples of Latin America, the Constitution
makes provision for exceptional measures to guarantee social peace in the
country.   These mechanisms include the state of seige when there is a
situation of "internal shock" in the country.   It was in virtue of this
provision that the state of seige was proclaimed between 7 November 1984
and 17 June 1985.   However, the Government points out that with a view
to protecting freedom of association, Supreme Decree No. 1216 was adopted;
it establishes regulations concerning the right of assembly and does not
require any authorisation, but simply an advance notice of five days, for
the holding of meetings by organisations endowed with legal personality
in their own premises.

	779.	As regards the inquiry by a special judge into the disappearance
and death of Mr. Antonio Aguirre Ballesteros, the Government points out
that the legal proceedings are at the investigatory stage.   In accordance
with the Code of Penal Procedure, in force since 1907, this stage of the
proceedings is carried out in secret.

	780.	With regard to the inquiry into the death of Messrs. José Manuel
Parada, Manuel Guerrero and Santiago Natina, the Government also points
out that the legal proceedings are at the investigatory stage.   The examining
magistrate has indicted two former police officers on the charge of having
"falsified public documents".

	781.	With regard to the allegations concerning the attack against the
premises of the National Democratic Development Project (PRODEN), the Government
states, in its communication of 8 August 1985, that this body is a public
company set up in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code governing
company contracts.   The leaders of this company are former deputies of
Congress and the premises which house its headquarters are not trade union
premises.   The police categorically reject the allegation that they entered
these premises.

	782.	As regards the events which occurred in the headquarters of the
Confederation of Building Workers, the Government explains in its communication
of 11 September 1985 that on the day of the attack the carabineers of the
Fourth Station went to the premises of the
Confederation in order to investigate
the offences committed.   The carabineers found 20,000 political pamphlets
of a subversive nature as well as abundant propaganda and material in support
of doctrines which advocate the use of violence.   The Minister of the
Interior instructed the courts to carry out an inquiry and punish the guilty
parties.   Following this inquiry, the examining magistrate indicted Messrs.
Troncoso, Figueroa, Rivera and Bustamante on charges of having infringed
section 4(f) of the State Security Act (which punishes those persons who
disseminate doctrines designed to destroy the republican and democratic
form of the Government) and ordered their detention.

	783.	During the inquiry, the magistrate called Mr. Manuel Bustos as a
witness and subsequently ordered his arrest, after interrogation, as a
preventive measure in accordance with the powers conferred on him by the
Code of Penal Procedure.   Following an appeal for protection by his counsel,
Mr. Bustos was released on the instructions of the Appeal Court of Santiago.
Furthermore, the examining magistrate accepted a request for bail by
the four leaders of the Confederation.   This measure was approved on 7
June 1985 by the Appeal Court of Santiago.   Subsequently, on 22 July 1985,
the examining magistrate ordered the dismissal of the charges against the
accused, thus putting an end to the proceedings, since there was insufficient
evidence to bring charges against certain persons.   The matter is therefore
closed.

	784.	As regards the allegations concerning the arrests made after a search
was carried out of the premises of the Chilectra trade union, the Government
explains that a clandestine meeting had been held on these premises of
political parties which had been declared illegal because of their support
of terrorism.   The purpose of this meeting was to pay homage to the Socialist
Party of Chile and its founder.   The participants included persons from
outside the Chilectra trade union and the Chilean electricity undertaking
and had no relation, even of an indirect nature, with trade union activities.
The persons arrested were released after their identity had been verified.
Messrs. Victor Hugo Gac and Eugenio Madrid Salgado were banished to Chaiten
for a period of three months and Mr. Manuel Dinamarca to Ciudad de Palena
for the same period.   At the present time, these persons are free to move
throughout the country, since their banishment has terminated.

	785.	As regards the events which occurred at Villa Minera Andina on 1 May
1985, the Government points out that each year the workers of this town
celebrate the labour day holiday by organising in particular a religious
ceremony, a football championship and athletic events in the streets of
the town.   The Government adds that because of police regulations, prior
authorisation must be requested to hold such events in the public thoroughfare.
However, the athletic event was held in the streets without such authorisation.
There was a traffic accident in which several persons were injured.
The police officer who made the report arrested the person apparently
responsible for the accident, Mr. Arturo Uribe, director of one of the
organising trade unions.   Other trade union leaders accompanied him to
the
police station.   Subsequently, the Chief of Police ordered the immediate
release of all persons detained.   The Government states that another person
mentioned by the complainants, Mr. Raúl Montecinos, is free and that it
has no information on the alleged searches carried out in the homes of
trade union leaders.

	786.	Furthermore, the Government provides information on the persons mentioned
as having been arrested and banished in the Committee's 239th Report (see
Annex).   The Government points out that the banishments in question were
ordered by virtue of the powers vested in Head of State by the Constitution
during the state of siege.   On 17 June 1985 the state of siege which had
been in force since 7 November 1984 was lifted.   Under the Constitution,
the period of banishment may not exceed 90 days.   The events which led
to these measures were participation in clandestine activities of partisan
politics which had no relation to trade union activities.   At no moment,
the Government points out, did it attempt to weaken the trade union movement
by depriving it of its leaders or hindering its activities.   In conclusion,
on this point the Government believes that the information supplied shows
that there has never been an atmosphere of violence against the trade unions.
It does not share the opinion expressed in the conclusions of the Committee
because the latter has generalised cases of an exceptional nature and has
erroneously equated violent acts with trade union activities.

	787.	As regards the allegations concerning the right of assembly, the
Government reaffirms that during the state of siege, meetings of trade
union organisations endowed with legal personality may take place in their
own premises without prior authorisation, provided that an advance notice
of five days is given to the office of the provincial governor.   On 17
June 1985 the state of siege was lifted and replaced by a state of emergency
for a period of 90 days, because of the existence of internal danger to
national security.   The Directorate of the zone declared to be in a state
of emergency in the metropolitan region and the Province of San Antonio
passed a decree establishing that meetings of organisations endowed with
legal personality, assemblies for the establishment of trade unions and
federations, as well as meetings organised in the exercise of the rights
of workers and of legally recognised trade unions do not require authorisation,
provided that they are held in the premises of the organisation and that
their exclusive purpose is to examine matters considered under the legislation
relevant to their objectives.

	788.	Concerning the allegation regarding the prohibition of a meeting
of Works' Union No. 6 of CODELCO, El Salvador Division, the Government
points out, in its communication of 29 August 1985, that reasons of internal
security obliged the authorities to suspend the right of assembly during
these days.   This exceptional situation did in no way paralyse  trade
union activity since during this period eight trade union meetings were
held in the second fortnight of March by the trade unions of the El Salvador
Division as well as elections by the complainant organisation on 2 July
1985.   An appeal for
protection was lodged with the Appeal Court of Copiapó
and was rejected.

	789.	As regards the situation of Mr. Pedro Araya, leader of the National
Trade Union of Professional Pilots and Technicians of the Lan-Chile company,
the Government states, in its communication of 11 September 1985, that
this trade union changed its executive on 6 and 13 September 1984; only
three persons out of a total of 18 members participated in the vote.
The undertaking then asked the Appeal Court of Santiago to dissolve the
trade union under section 52(d) of Legislative Decree No. 2756 respecting
trade union organisations, which makes provision for a minimum number of
members (for works unions 25 members, representing at least 10 per cent
of all the workers in the undertaking).   On 23 November 1984, the Appeal
Court declared the trade union dissolved.   Following an appeal by the
union executive to the Supreme Court, the latter confirmed the initial
ruling.   On 30 April 1985, before the Labour Inspectorate of Maipú, Mr.
Pedro Araya, signed an end-of-service receipt and received compensation
equivalent to US$31,000.

	790.	As regards the situation of Mr. Rodolfo Seguel, the Government states,
in its communication of 15 August 1985, that he was dismissed from the
CODELCO undertaking on 12 July 1983 for reasons which are covered by section
15, Nos. 3 and 4 of Legislative Decree No. 2200, in relation with the State
Security Act No. 12927 of 1958, namely numerous acts likely to cause and
promote work stoppages in the El Teniente Division as well as other unlawful
acts.   Mr. Seguel's defence counsel subsequently asked the Second Civil
Court of Rancagua to revoke the dismissal.   On 12 March 1984, the court
rejected the appeal and thus confirmed the dismissal.   Following an appeal
lodged by Mr. Seguel's counsel, on 28 June 1984, the Appeal Court of Rancagua
annulled the ruling of the court of first instance.   The CODELCO undertaking
then lodged an "appeal of complaint" with the Supreme Court which, on 18
July 1985, confirmed the ruling issued by the court of first instance.
Following a further appeal for "re-examination" lodged by Mr. Seguel's
counsel, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision of the members of the
competent chamber, confirmed the dismissal.   The Government points out
that it was thus as a result of a decision by the judicial authorities
and not the Government that Mr. Seguel was disqualified from exercising
the trade union functions which he had held.

	791.	The Government points out in this connection that the statutes of
the Confederation of Copper Workers stipulate, in article 21, that the
loss of the status of leader of an affiliated trade union entails the loss
of the status as member of the Executive Council of the Confederation.
Furthermore, the statutes of the first level trade union stipulate that
in order to be a trade union leader a worker must be employed in the undertaking.
Despite his dismissal, Mr. Seguel had been leader of the Caletones occupational
trade union, No. 1 of the El Teniente Division.

	792.	The Government points out that Mr. Seguel may not exercise trade
union functions in the Confederation of Copper Workers pursuant to the
statutes which the workers themselves have established.   On the basis
of several principles of the Committee on Freedom of Association in this
respect, the Government believes that the proceedings have respected freedom
of association.   In the Annex to its communication the Government includes
the judgements of the courts of first and second instance as well as the
final decision of the Supreme Court.

	793.	As regards the allegations concerning the arrest of Mr. Sergio Troncoso,
the Government points out that this person was arrested for encouraging
disorder and incidents in the street.   He was banished to Melinka on 6
August 1985 and then transferred to Puerto Cisnes on 22 August.   The Government
adds that the other person mentioned by the complainants, Mr. Juan Ponce,
has not been arrested or banished.

	794.	As regards the events which took place during the demonstration of
4 September 1985, the Government states in its communication of 16 October
1985 that the Ministry of the Interior has requested the courts to determine
the responsibility of the instigators, organisers and promoters of this
protest day as well as that of the participants.   The Santiago Court has
indicted Messrs. Seguel and Bustos on charges of violations of several
provisions of the State Security Act (meetings aimed at the overthrow of
the Government or at conspiracy against its stability;  calling of public
meetings in public places without authorisation or liable to disturb public
order;  inciting the interruption of collective suspension of or strikes
in public services or public utilities which involve disturbances of public
order or in these services).   The Court held Messrs. Seguel and Bustos
to be repeated offenders.   Following an appeal by their defence counsel,
the Supreme Court unanimously confirmed the decision of the Court of First
Instance.   The four AGECH leaders were also arrested for their participation
in the demonstration of 4 September 1985.   According to the Government,
this day of protest led to ten deaths, the serious wounding of 18 police
officers, over 100 injured persons, damage amounting to 100 million pesos
caused by violent acts and serious damage to public property.   The judicial
proceedings instituted against the responsible parties is at present continuing.

D.
The Committee's conclusions

	795.	The Committee has taken note of the detailed replies furnished by
the Government concerning the various aspects of this case.   It has also
noted the general comments made by the Government concerning the trade
union situation in Chile.   Although it shares the opinion of the Government
that political questions do not fall within its sphere of competence, the
Committee must stress the
importance of the principle affirmed in 1970
by the International Labour Conference in its resolution concerning trade
union rights and their relation to civil liberties that "the rights conferred
upon workers' and employers' organisations must be based on respect for
those civil liberties which have been enunciated in particular in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights and that the absence of these civil liberties removes
all meaning from the concept of trade union rights".   The Committee therefore
believes that it is empowered, within the terms of its mandate, to examine
to what extent the exercise of trade union rights may be affected in cases
which allege the infringement of civil liberties.

	796.	As regards the inquiries carried out into the deaths of Messrs. Aguirre,
Parada, Guerrero and Natina, the Committee notes that the proceedings are
still at the investigatory stage and that in the case concerning the three
last mentioned persons, charges have been brought against two former police
officers.   The Committee, while observing the excessive duration of these
investigations, expresses its firm hope that they will be completed very
soon and will result in the determination of responsibilities so that the
guilty parties can be punished.   The Committee requests the Government
to keep it informed of any developments in these matters.

	797.	As regards the attacks against trade union premises, the Committee
notes that, according to the Government, the forces of order did not enter
these premises except in the case of the Confederation of Building Workers
where they made inquiries concering precisely the assault on the trade
union headquarters which had taken place a few hours before.   In these
circumstances, the Committee can only stress the importance of protecting
trade union premises and the need to shed light on these incidents which
have occurred on several occasions.   The Committee therefore urges the
Government to initiate judicial inquiries into the matter so that the perpetrators
of such acts, which are particularly prejudicial to the exercise of trade
union rights, may be identified as soon as possible.   It requests the
Government to keep it informed in this respect.

	798.	As regards the arrest and banishment of trade unionists, the Committee
notes that the persons mentioned in the Annex to its previous report have
regained their freedom of movement.   It points out, however, that despite
the lifting of the state of siege, several allegations refer to new arrests
and banishments concerning which the Government has supplied certain information
(see Annex).   In the Committee's opinion the repeated application of measures
of this type cannot but prove detrimental to labour relations in the country.
The Committee therefore requests the Government, with a view to restoring
a climate of social peace and normal trade union activity, to take the
necessary measures to end these banishments as soon as possible.   It requests
the Government to keep it informed of all steps taken to this end.

	799.	Furthermore, the Committee notes that several trade union leaders
(Messrs. Troncoso, Fugueroa, Rivera, Bustamente and Bustos) have been either
indicted or taken into custody and then released following the dropping
of charges.   In this respect the Committee must point out that the arrest
by the authorities of trade unionists against whom no subsequent charges
are brought may involve restrictions on freedom of association.   Governments
should take measures to ensure that the authorities concerned receive appropriate
instructions to prevent the dangers involved for trade union activities
by unjustified measures of arrest.   [See, in this regard, 207th Report,
Case No. 963 (Grenada), para. 229;  211th Report, Case No. 1025 (Haiti),
para. 272.]

	800.	The Committee has, furthermore, received more recent allegations
concerning the indictment of several trade union leaders including Messrs.
Seguel and Bustos, and of their arrest following a demonstration organised
by the National Grouping of Workers.   The Committee notes that, according
to the Government, these measures were taken by the courts on the basis
of offences committed under the State Security Act.   It notes that among
the provisions referred to by the courts is that concerning the organisation
of strikes in public services which, in the present case, took place during
the national day of protest.   It recalls in this connection that trade
union organisations should be able to have recourse to protest strikes
with a view to defending the economic and social interests of their members.
The Committee requests the Government to supply information on the outcome
of the judicial proceedings under way against those responsible for and
the organisers of the day of protest.

	801.	As regards the right of assembly, the Committee has noted the explanation
supplied by the Government concerning the prohibition of a meeting by Works
Union No. 6 of CODELCO, El Salvador Division, and its statements concerning
the new provisions adopted in this respect during the state of emergency.
It notes in particular that under certain circumstances, no prior authorisation
is required for trade union meetings held within the premises of the organisations.
The Government does not, however, state whether the authorities must
be notified of these meetings.   In general, the Committee must once again
point out that freedom of trade union assembly is one of the fundamental
aspects of trade union rights and that the public authorities should refrain
from any intervention likely to limit this right or impede its lawful exercise.

	802.	The Committee has also been informed of several allegations concerning
the dismissal of trade union leaders in the teaching, aviation, ports and
mines sectors.   The Government transmitted replies on the dismissal of
Messrs. Pedro Araya, President of the Union of Professional and Technical
Pilots, and Seguel, leader of the Confederation of Copper Workers.   The
Committee notes in particular that Mr. Pedro Araya accepted compensation
for his dismissal after his trade union had been dissolved by the courts
because of insufficient membership numbers.   In this respect, the Committee
recalls that it does not appear that sufficient protection against acts
of anti-union
discrimination is accorded by legislation which, in practice,
enables employers, on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed
by law for cases of unfair dismissal, to get rid of any worker when the
true reason for dismissal is his trade union membership or activity.
[See, for example, 211th Report, Case No. 1053 (Dominican Republic), para.
163.]

	803.	As regards the case of Mr. Seguel, the Committee notes that this
person was dismissed after judicial proceedings, according to the Government,
for having carried out in particular acts to instigate or encourage work
stoppages.   In these circumstances, the Committee must observe that Mr.
Seguel's dismissal was due to acts which he carried out in pursuance of
his trade union responsibilities and that such a dismissal is therefore
a measure of anti-union discrimination.   This measure is all the more
serious since under the legislation and statutes of the Confederation of
Copper Workers, Mr. Seguel can no longer be empowered with a trade union
mandate.   When trade union leaders are dismissed for having exercised
their right to strike, the Committee cannot but conclude that they have
been punished for their trade union activities and are the subject of anti-union
discrimination.   The fact that a judicial authority intervenes in the
dismissal procedure does not necessarily constitute, in the opinion of
the Committee, a sufficient guarantee against acts of anti-union discrimination,
since the powers of the judges in question are limited to ensuring that
the national legislation has been correctly applied.   Furthermore, the
dismissal of a trade union leader is liable to infringe the freedom of
action of his organisation and its right to elect its representatives in
full freedom, and may even leave the way open for acts of interference
by the employer.   [See, for example, 147th Report, Case No. 667 (Sudan),
para. 222.]

	804.	The Committee notes furthermore that the Government has not replied
concerning the dismissals of trade union leaders in the teaching sector
(Messrs. Mancilla, Aguilar, Maldonado, Trujillo, Torres) and in the port
sector (Mr. Aguirre).   The Committee requests the Government to supply
its observations in this respect.

The Committee's recommendations

	805.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following
conclusions:

(a)
The Committee notes that, since its last examination of this case, several
matters which had been the subject of allegations before the Committee
have not been dealt with by the administrative authorities, but have been
placed before the judiciary.
(b)
As regards the inquiries carried out into the death of Messrs. Aguirre,
Parada, Guerrero and Natina, the Committee notes that proceedings are still
at the investigatory stage.   While observing the excessive duration of
these investigations, it expresses the firm hope that these inquiries will
be concluded rapidly and will result in the determination of responsibilities
so that the guilty parties can be punished.   The Committee requests the
Government to keep it informed of developments in these matters.

(c)
As regards the attacks against trade union premises, the Committee notes
that, according to the Government, the forces of order did not enter these
premises.   The Committee stresses the importance of protecting trade union
premises.   It urges the Government to initiate judicial inquiries into
the matter so that the responsible parties may be identified as soon as
possible and requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.

(d)
As regards the arrest and banishment of trade unionists, the Committee
notes that the persons mentioned in the Annex of its previous report have
regained their freedom of movement.   It observes, however, that despite
the lifting of the state of siege, several allegations refer to new arrests
and banishments concerning which the Government has supplied certain information.
The Committee requests the Government, with a view to restoring social
peace and normal trade union activities, to take the necessary measures
to end these banishments as soon as possible.   It also asks the Government
to keep it informed of all steps taken to this end.

(e)
As regards the indictment and preventive detention of trade union leaders,
the Committee points out that the arrest by the authorities of trade unionists
against whom no subsequent charges are brought may involve restrictions
to freedom of association.   The Government should take measures to ensure
that the authorities concerned receive appropriate instructions to prevent
the dangers involved for trade union activities by unjustified measures
of arrest.    The Committee reminds the Government that trade union organisations
should be able to have recourse to protest strikes with a view to defending
the economic and social interests of their members.   It requests the Government
to supply information on the outcome of the judicial proceedings under
way against those responsible for and the organisers of the day of protest
held on 4 September 1985.

(f)
As regards the right of assembly, the Committee recalls in general that
freedom of trade union assembly is one of the fundamental aspects of trade
union rights and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference
which is likely to limit this right or impede its lawful exercise.

(g)
As regards the dismissals of trade union leaders, the Committee points
out that the dismissal of a trade union leader is liable,
by reason of
the fact that dismissal causes him to lose his status as a trade union
officer, to infringe the freedom of association of his organisation and
its right to elect its representatives in full freedom and may even leave
the way open for acts of interference by the employer.   The Committee
requests the Government to furnish its observations concerning the dismissals
of trade union leaders in the teaching and port sectors.

Case No. 1326

COMPLAINTS PRESENTED BY THE WORLD FEDERATION OF TEACHERS'
UNIONS AND THE SRAMIK KARMACHARI OKKYA PARISHAD
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF BANGLADESH

	806.	The World Federation of Teachers' Unions presented a complaint of
violations of trade union rights in a communication dated 3 April 1985.
The Sramik Karmachari Okkya Parishad, jointly with the following 14 Bangladeshi
trade union federations, presented its complaint on 27 May 1985:  Bangladesh
Workers Federation, Bangladesh Trade Union Sangha, Bangladesh Federation
of Labour, Bangladesh Trade Union Kandra, Jatio Sramik Federation, Ganatantrik
Sramik Andolon, Jatio Sramik League, Samaj Tantrik Sramik Federation, Jatio
Sramik Jote, Sangukta Sramik Federation, Jatio Sramik League - Bangladesh,
Bangla Sramik Federation, Bangladesh Sramik Federation, Jatiotabadi Sramik
Dal.   The Government replied in a communication dated 29 June 1985.

	807.	Bangladesh has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection
of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) and the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No.98);  it has not ratified
the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention, 1978 (No. 151).

A.
The complainants' allegations

	808.	In its communication of 3 April 1985, the World Federation of Teachers'
Unions alleges the detention, at the beginning of March, of several teachers
including Mr. Shareful Islam and Mr. Ppal Abdul Mannan, President and Secretary-General
respectively of the Bangladesh College Teachers' Association (BCTA), an
affiliate of this complainant, after the reimposition of martial law on
1 March 1985.   The complainant states that they have been sentenced to
one month's detention by application of the Special Power Act No. 74.
It points out that Mr. Shareful Islam has already suffered, in the past,
several months' imprisonment because of his trade union activities.   It
denounces the Government of Bangladesh for violations of Conventions Nos.
87, 98, 151 and the joint ILO/UNESCO Recommendation on the Status of Teachers
of 1966.   It fears that the detention will be extended
and requests the
cessation of proceedings and the release of the imprisoned teachers.

	809.	In the communication of 27 May 1985 presented jointly by a total
of 15 Bangladeshi trade union federations, it is alleged that the Government
has violated Conventions Nos. 87 and 98 by the introduction of martial
law on l March 1985.   According to the federations, under martial law,
trade union activities are banned as are the holding of meetings, collective
bargaining and strikes.

	810.	The complainants state that the Government has arrested many trade
unionists without giving reasons and has held them in custody over the
last few months without trial.

	811.	More specifically, the complainants refer to the following legislation
as infringing freedom of association:  the Industrial Relations Ordinance
of 1969 (which restricts the right to join trade unions of public servants
and management staff and which restricts election to union office to those
employed in the particular establishment);  Rule 10 of Industrial Relations
Regulations of 1977 (which empowers the Registrar of Trade Unions to enter
trade union premises and inspect or seize any union record).   The complainants
also allege that public sector employees and public servants are denied
the right to bargain collectively.

B.
The Government's reply

	812.	In its communication of 29 June 1985, the Government states that
there is no registered trade union in Bangladesh named the "Bangladesh
College Teachers' Association" and that Mr. Shareful Islam and Mr. Abdul
Mannan are not known in the trade union sphere as trade union leaders.

	813.	Moreover, according to the Government, the law prohibits any trade
union activity by any organisation which has not been registered under
the Industrial Relations Ordinance and such activity would be a penal offence.
Nevertheless, no prosecution proceedings have been commenced by the Registrar
of Trade Unions against the persons in question.   The Government states
that it is examining the case very carefully and will furnish detailed
information shortly.

C.
The Committee's conclusions

	814.	The Committee notes that this case concerns the re-imposition of
martial law in Bangladesh on l March 1985 and the alleged consequent arrest
of several teachers including two teachers' union leaders, Mr. Shareful
Islam and Mr. Abdul Mannan.   The
complainants also allege that the current
labour legislation infringes the principles of freedom of association.

	815.	The Committee observes that, although one of the complainants infers
that Mr. Shareful Islam was arrested because of his trade union activities,
the Government denies that the two named individuals are known in the trade
union sphere as trade union leaders and that proceedings have been instituted
against them by the Registrar of Trade Unions.   It also points out that
there is no registered trade union of the name of their organisation, namely
the Bangladesh College Teachers' Association.   In this respect, the Committee
recalls that it has already had occasion to examine similar allegations
against the Government of Bangladesh concerning Mr. Shareful Islam when
he was Secretary-General of the Bangladesh College Teachers' Association
(Case No. 1246 examined in the Committee's 234th Report, paras. 66 to 74,
approved by the Governing Body at its 226th Session, May-June 1984).
In that case the Government recognised both the existence of the trade
union association involved and Mr. Islam's role in it.

	816.	The Committee regrets that the complainant organisations, despite
having opportunities to do so, did not supply more detailed information
as to the circumstances surrounding the alleged arrests, in particular
the arrest of Mr. Abdul Mannan and Mr. Islam.   However, in view of the
fact that at least in the case of Mr. Islam, his trade union role and activities
have been put forward as the sole basis for the action taken against him,
the Committee would stress that, in such cases, it has considered it incumbent
upon the Government to show that the measures taken were in no way occasioned
by the trade union activities of the individual concerned.  [See, for example,
103rd Report, Case No. 536 (Gabon), para. 292.] Given that the Government
has undertaken to supply further information, the Committee hopes that
details will be forthcoming as to whether any arrests took place (and,
if so, for what reasons and on the basis of which legislation, i.e. under
the Special Power Act No. 74, under the Industrial Relations Ordinance
or other legislation), so as to enable it to reach conclusions on this
aspect of the case in full knowledge of the facts.

	817.	As regards the alleged restrictions on trade union rights consequent
on the re-introduction of martial law and the specific restrictions on
the freedom of association and collective bargaining rights of public employees
contained in the labour legislation, the Committee notes that the ILO Committee
of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, in its
l985 examination of the Government's compliance with its obligations under
Conventions Nos. 87 and 98, pointed to several discrepancies between the
rights guaranteed under these Conventions and the present legislation.

	818.	In particular, the Committee of Experts in its observation concerning
Convention No. 87 noted that, under section 2(xxviii)(b) of the Industrial
Relations Ordinance, the definition of a worker excludes a person who is
employed in a managerial or administrative
capacity.   It noted the Government's
statement that it is not possible to determine the nature of the employment
covered by this provision or the number of persons concerned.   The Committee
of Experts pointed out that, by virtue of Article 9 of Convention No. 87,
only the armed forces and the police may be excluded from the scope of
the Convention and that the rights it sets forth must, therefore, also
be recognised to public servants and managerial staff.   It requested the
Government to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee the application of
the principles of the Convention to these categories of workers.   The
Committee of Experts also observed that section 7A(l)(a)(ii) and (b) of
the Industrial Relations Ordinance limits the right to be a member or officer
of a trade union to persons actually employed in an establishment or group
of establishments concerned.   It considered that a provision of this kind
restricts the right of workers to establish and to join organisations of
their own choosing (Article 2 of Convention No. 87), to elect their representatives
in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities (Article 3).
It noted with interest the Government's statement that it was prepared
to examine these provisions and that measures to ease them are under study,
and pointed out that the free exercise of the right to establish and to
join unions implies the free determination of the structure and composition
of unions.   It also considered that restrictive conditions attached to
trade union office constitute interference in the internal affairs of the
unions.   The Committee of Experts, therefore, hoped that these provisions
would be repealed in the near future.   In addition, the Committee of Experts
noted that, under Rule 10 of the Industrial Relations Regulations, 1977,
the Registrar or any other officer authorised by him may enter the premises
of a trade union or federation of trade unions and inspect and seize any
record, register or other document.   This procedure, under which an administrative
authority has wide powers of supervision over the internal affairs of a
trade union, is, according to the Committee of Experts, incompatible with
the right of workers to organise their administration (Article 3 of Convention
No. 87).   The Committee again requested the Government to reconsider this
provision.

	819.	In its 1985 observation concerning Bangladesh's observance of Convention
No. 98, the Committee of Experts emphasised that, under Article 4 of this
Convention, it is the responsibility of the Government to take appropriate
measures to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation
of machinery for voluntary negotiation, and noted that it had previously
observed that, under the State-Owned Manufacturing Industries Act, No.
X of 1974, the Government may determine wages and other conditions of employment
(leave) for any worker employed in this sector.   Referring to its General
Survey submitted to the 69th (1983) Session of the International Labour
Conference, particularly paragraph 311, the Committee of Experts pointed
out that the right to negotiate wages and conditions of employment freely
with the employers and their organisations is a fundamental aspect of freedom
of association and that if, for compelling reasons of national economic
interest, a government considers that wage rates cannot be fixed freely
through collective agreements, such a restriction should be imposed as
an
exceptional measure and only so far as is necessary, without exceeding
a reasonable period and should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to
protect the living standards of the workers.   It accordingly requested
the Government to reconsider the situation in the light of these comments,
with a view to restoring voluntary bargaining in the sector concerned.

	820.	Despite the lack of a specific reply from the Government on the legislative
aspect of the case, the Committee can only recall the Committee of Experts'
request that the Government reconsider the legislative situation with a
view to bringing the legislation into conformity with the principles of
freedom of association.   It reaches this decision in particular since,
in past cases [See 235th and 238th Reports, Cases Nos. 997, 999 and 1029
(Turkey), paras. 33 and 36], the Committee has stressed that martial law
is incompatible with the full exercise of trade union rights.

The Committee's recommendations

	821.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:

(a)
in view of the lack of information from both the complainants and the
Government concerning the alleged arrest of two named teachers' union leaders,
the Committee hopes that the further reply promised by the Government will
shed light on the circumstances so as to enable it to reach conclusions
on this aspect of the case in full knowledge of the facts;

(b)
the Committee recalls the Committee of Experts' request - made in the
context of its 1985 examination of the Government's application of Conventions
Nos. 87 and 98 - that the Government reconsider the legislative situation
regarding the right to organise of managerial and administrative employees,
election to trade union office, administrative powers of supervision over
the internal affairs of unions and collective bargaining in State-owned
manufacturing industries, so as to bring the legislation into conformity
with the principles of freedom of association.

Case No. 1330

COMPLAINT PRESENTED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF
AGRICULTURAL, COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYEES
AND FIVE OTHER TRADE UNIONS
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF GUYANA

	822.	The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Association
of Agricultural, Commercial and Industrial Employees (NAACIE) dated 9 April
1985.   The Government replied in a communication dated 31 July 1985.

	823.	Guyana has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of
the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) and the Right to Organise
and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).   It has also ratified
the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention, 1978 (No. 151).

A.
The complainants' allegations

	824.	The complainants allege that fundamental norms and principles proclaimed
in accepted international labour practice are being deliberately and systematically
flouted as a result of government policy;  that freedom of association
and trade union rights have come under assault as a result of deliberate
government action, including the concurrent holding of public office and
of positions of responsibility within the Trade Union Congress by government
ministers and senior public officials and through the employment of intimidation
to prevent the recognition of freely chosen trade unions.   In addition
it is alleged that the right of collective bargaining has been directly
attacked through the Government's imposition of a negotiating partner for
public sector employees, and by the removal of contractual rights through
the Labour Amendment Act.

	825.	In a memorandum contained in its communication, the complainant sets
out details concerning a number of industrial disputes which it alleges
involved discriminatory and or intimidatory action against workers and
trade union officials who had been engaged in strikes which had occurred
in March and May 1983 respectively in government-owned enterprises in the
packaging and the mining industries;  and provides instances of such action
which it alleges was taken against trade union members and officials in
other state-owned enterprises.   It also provides information relating
to events which took place in March 1984 in relation to the sugar industry
concerning workers employed by the Guyana Sugar Corporation, which it alleges
gave rise to the passage of the Labour Amendment Act and elaborates its
objections to this legislation which it claims, inter alia, altered the
fundamental rights clause of the Constitution
in relation to property;
reversed a Court of Appeal decision upholding the contractual rights of
workers in the sugar industry;  and interfered with free collective bargaining
by making an agreement entered into in 1977 between the Guyana Trades Union
Congress (GTUC) and the Government, and any other such agreement entered
into in future, binding on all public sector employees.

	826.	In relation to the last of these matters, the complainant states
that there can be no genuine or proper collective bargaining between the
Government and the GTUC because two Ministers and a Parliamentary Secretary
are members of the GTUC executive and are privy to all decisions taken
at executive level;  as the ministers are said to accept the doctrine of
paramountcy of the party and are bound by oath to Cabinet secrecy, it is
the Government that benefits from their presence on the GTUC executive.

	827.	Concerning the action taken against trade union members and officials
in the mining industry, the complainant alleges that 1,721 workers at Guyana
Mining Enterprises Limited were dismissed under the guise of retrenchment
in July 1983, following a general strike in the bauxite industry which
had resulted from the imposition by the employers of a three-day week in
retaliation for a one-day-per-week strike decided in May 1983 by the Guyana
Mine Workers Union (GMWU) and the Guyana Bauxite Supervisors Union (GBSU).
Among those affected were a number of trade union officials, including
the President of the GBSU, the Treasurer of the GMWU and all the shop stewards.
Efforts by the GTUC to secure reinstatement of the workers had been unsuccessful.

	828.	Actions relating to workers employed at Seals and Packaging Industry
Limited (in which a majority of the shares are said to be owned by the
Government) which are the subject of the complaint are alleged to have
arisen after workers in the industry had requested the complainant to act
as their sole bargaining agent in February 1983;  its application was referred
by the company to the Ministry of Labour for advice following a request
for bargaining rights on behalf of the workers by the Guyana Labour Union
(GLU), which, the complainant alleges, is government-backed.   The complainant
states that the Ministry sought the guidance of the GTUC which it alleges
was supporting and had been controlled by the Government.   It further
alleges that pressure was brought to bear on workers to join the GLU, which
it claims they refused to do (it attaches a petition signed by 27 workers
and addressed to the GTUC, inter alia supporting the GTUC's advice that
a poll be held and pledging their support to the complainant).   It states
that shortly thereafter two of its militant members were retrenched although
they were skilled workers, and casual workers were retained;  that this
gave rise to a protest strike by the entire workforce, which was only called
off after two days, following an agreement between the complainant's General
Secretary and the Chief Labour Officer.   On reporting for duty following
the ending of the strike, all workers were, according to the complainant,
refused entry and served with letters stating that, as a result of the
strike action, management had concluded that they had of their own volition
and by design terminated their employment.   The complainant states that
subsequently it advised workers to accept offers of re-employment despite
the company's indication to some workers that this would happen only if
they stopped union agitation.   Seven of the workers were not re-employed.
The complainant concludes this aspect of its allegations by stating that
the workers at the company are still insisting that it be recognised as
sole bargaining agent, but that the Government will not allow an independent
union to make inroads into the public sector and is guilty of fostering
"company unionism".

	829.	Other allegations of anti-union discrimination by the complainants
concern:  (a) the dismissal, by the General Secretary of the General Workers
Union of one of the union's field officers and the Treasurer, both of whom
are said to have applied to the courts for redress, though this process
is said to be tardy, and the retrenchment of another field officer following
his reversion to service with the Guyana Rice Board.   These dismissals
are said to have taken place because the individuals involved voted in
GTUC elections against the wishes of the ruling party; (b) under the same
heading, the complainant refers to the dismissal of two employees of the
Guyana Co-operative Mortgage Finance Bank.

B.
The Government's reply

	830.	In its communication of 31 July the Government denies the complainant's
general allegation concerning the flouting of international labour standards;
it points out that no evidence is adduced in this regard and that, although
it also denies that there have been departures from good industrial relations,
it is of the view that the complainants have been unable to show that alleged
defects of this kind have been deliberately occasioned by the Government
or its policies.   It also denies that freedom of association and other
trade union rights are under assault by the Government as alleged.

	831.	It states that the two Ministers and the Parliamentary Secretary
who are on the executive of the GTUC were elected to that body prior to
their appointment to government office, and that they continue to serve
the TUC, having been re-elected to their positions;  that there is nothing
in the Constitution of the GTUC to disqualify them from holding such positions
while holding ministerial ofice;  and it cites precedents from other countries
in the West Indies where public personalities have occupied ministerial
posts at the same time as high trade union office.

	832.	On the question of the use of intimidation to prevent the recognition
of freely chosen trade unions, the Government states that the party in
power does not use intimidatory tactics, and that recognition issues are
processed in accordance with accepted procedures.   Where such issues involve
trade unions which are members of the GTUC they are submitted to that body,
which is independent and
whose deliberations the party in office cannot
and does not direct, and which thereafter submits its advice to the Ministry
of Manpower and Co-operatives for further action.

	833.	According to the Government the right to collective bargaining is
not being attacked.   It points out in this regard that it has recently
ratified Convention No. 154 on the Right to Collective Bargaining and that
it fully respects is obligations thereunder.   It further points out that
the complainant unions are part of a GTUC delegation which is presently
negotiating wage increases in the public sector, and that all the unions
in that sector form part of the GTUC's team which negotiates with the Government.

	834.	As regards the allegations relating to the mining industry, an annexure
attached to the Government's communication states that, although Guyana
Mining Enterprises Limited is wholly owned by the Government, it would
be wrong to assume that any breach by the company of accepted labour relations
practices indicates a breach by the Government of its obligations under
international labour instruments.   It adds that the complainants' allegations
are wholly lacking in merit;  that the company's initial reduction of the
working week during the course of the one-day-per-week stoppage was not
retaliation but the result of economic considerations, i.e. considerable
losses which were being sustained since 1982 and which would in any event
have led to a reduction in the workforce;  that the sudden and unstructured
reduction in the effective strengh of the workforce by that stoppage made
matters worse so that the only alternative to shutting down operations
completely was a reduction in the working week;  and that the general strike
in the industry had further exacerbated the situation.   The ending of
the strike had been preceded by an agreement that the company and the union
would meet for the purpose of recommending measures for the reduction in
operating costs and ensuring the continued viability of the enterprise;
such meetings had taken place, but no agreement had been reached and as
a result the company had been obliged to proceed with an exercise involving
limited retrenchment, details of which had been disclosed at a meeting
with the GTUC and the unions, at which the Minister of Manpower and Co-operatives
had presided, and which are outlined in the Government's communication.
These relate, inter alia, to the fact that 1,428 (not 1,721 as alleged)
employees had been retrenched, with a further 330 being reinstated later;
and to the categories of workers to be involved (according to age or length
of service) as well as the procedures to be followed by managers.   The
Government acknowledges that the entire branch executive of the union was
retrenched at one plant, along with other workers, and all union officers
but two had been retrenched at another plant, but it states that in the
first of these instances the plant had not operated as a production unit
for more than a year, and as regards the second the number by which the
workforce was reduced was decided without references to names or union
positions held.   It confirms that a number of union officials, including
some but not all shop stewards, were among those who have been retrenched,
but strongly denies any victimisation and states that the cause was economic
necessity and the
process took full account of the applicable criteria.
It points out furthermore that a number of the retrenched union officials
were among those who were reinstated and that this in its view corroborates
the absence of victimisation.

	835.	As regards the recognition aspects of the events at Seals and Packaging
Industry Limited, the Government refers to the fact that two unions had
requested sole bargaining rights, and that the company had asked for the
Ministry's assistance, following which it had sought the advice of the
GTUC in keeping with recognised and accepted industrial relations practice.
It had subsequently received a copy of a letter from 27 workers urging
the GTUC to advise the Ministry to conduct a poll in order to resolve the
dispute.   Up to the present, the GTUC had not tendered advice though it
had informed the Ministry in August 1983 that one of its committees had
been asked to expedite its report on the union recognition dispute.   The
Government adds that in the meantime the workers had decided against being
represented by either of the unions seeking sole bargaining rights and
were represented by a staff association;  there had been no agitation for
recognition of either union.

	836.	As regards dismissal of workers at Seals and Packaging Industry Limited,
the Government states that it was informed by the company that there had
been an unofficial strike involving 22 casual workers, over a period of
approximately one month in June and July 1983.   Three of those who had
been on strike returned to work at its conclusion and, although 19 had
been given notices of termination, all but seven (who had not responded
to the company's invitation to return) were re-employed without break of
service.   The dismissal of the seven was, the Government states, totally
unrelated to their trade union activities.   The Government further states
that the retrenchment of the two union activists referred to by the complainant
came about because the special project on which they had been working came
to an end and they had consequently become redundant.

	837.	As regards the other allegations of dismissals, the Government states
that it was not requested to mediate in the case of the two officials of
the General Workers Union (GWU) who were dismissed and have sought redress
through the courts, although it regards the complainant's remark about
the tardiness of the process as unfair and irresponsible, especially in
view of the reference in another part of the complaint to the role of the
courts in upholding claims by workers.   As to the GWU official who had
been retrenched after re-employment by the Guyana Rice Board, this person
had previously had no guaranteed post but had been employed seasonally;
he had been made redundant after the plant at which he had been employed
had been to a large extent destroyed by fire, which resulted in the laying
off of other employees there as well.   The Government denies any impropriety
on its part as regards the dismissal of the two employees of the Guyana
Co-operative Mortgage Finance Bank, in respect of whom no representations
had been made by the staff association of the bank and whom the Government
was advised had been dismissed, after warnings, for late arrivals at work.

	838.	Finally, as regards the Labour Amendment Act, the Government points
out that the matter is
sub judice
as the validity and constitutionality
of the entire Act are being challenged following the hearing of an extremely
complicated case in respect of which judgement had not yet been rendered;
it does, however, deny that the Act in any way violates the Constitution
or accepted labour relations practices and requirements.

C.
The conclusions of the Committee

	839.	The Committee observes that there appear to be four principal aspects
to the complainant's allegations.   These are:  (a) those relating to the
dual governmental and trade union functions of members of the GTUC executive;
(b) those relating to the deliberate policy which the Government is following
and which are said to amount to an assault on trade union rights and a
flouting of fundamental norms and practices of international labour practice;
(c) specified action in relation to industrial disputes or concerning
trade union activists which, it is claimed, involves the violation of trade
union rights;  and (d) the effects of the Labour Amendment Act on collective
bargaining and collective agreements.

	840.	With regard to the last of these, the Committee notes that the matter
is
sub judice
, as the result of a challenge to the validity and the constitutionality
of the Labour Amendment Act before the courts by three workers through
their union (the principal complainant in this case).   It requests the
Government to supply it with a copy of the judgement of the court as soon
as this is available, so that it may reach a conclusion on this aspect
of the case in full possession of all the relevant information.   At the
same time, it draws the matter to the attention of the Committee of Experts
on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.

	841.	As regards the dual governmental and trade union functions of members
of the GTUC executive, the Committee asks the complainants to supply details
on this allegation and, in particular, to indicate what consequences this
has on the exercise of trade union rights.

	842.	As regards the allegations relating to the Government's deliberate
policy of violations of trade union rights, their generalised character
and range lead the Committee to the conclusion that, in the absence of
more detailed information relating the alleged policy to a particular course
of conduct involving the infringement of rights of freedom of association,
this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.

	843.	Concerning the specific allegations of dismissals of workers and
trade union leaders, the Committee observes that the information supplied
by the complainants and by the Government are
contradictory.   It is consequently
of the view that it is not in a position to arrive at conclusions on this
aspect of the case.

	844.	On the subject of the recognition of sole bargaining rights at Seals
and Packaging Industry Limited, the Committee notes that the Government
chose to refer the matter for advice to the Guyana Trades Union Congress,
but that such advice has not been forthcoming despite the lapse of more
than two years since the question was first raised;  and the information
supplied by the Government to the effect that, in the meantime, the workers
have decided against being represented by a sole bargaining agent and are
represented by a staff association.   The Committee recalls its earlier
decisions that it is not necessarily incompatible with Convention No. 87
to provide for the certification of the most representative union in a
given unit as the exclusive bargaining agent, but that in such cases there
is a need to provide certain safeguards, which include (a) certification
by an independent body, and (b) the choice of the representative organisation
by a majority vote of the employees in the unit concerned.   [See, for
example, the 121st Report of the Committee, Case No. 624 (UK/British Honduras),
para. 56;  187th Report, Case No. 796 (Bahamas), para. 173;  222nd Report,
Case No. 1163 (Cyprus), para. 313.]   The Committee is of the view that
these principles are appropriate to the situation and expresses the hope
that the Government will find it possible to give effect to them.

The Committee's recommendations

	845.	In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following
conclusions:

(a)
The Committee requests the Government to supply it with a copy of the
judgement of the court concerning the validity and the constitutionality
of the Labour Amendment Act as soon as this becomes available, so that
it may reach a conclusion on this aspect of the case in full possession
of all the relevant information.

(b)
The Committee asks the complainant organisations to supply details on
their allegation concerning the dual governmental and trade union functions
of members of the GTUC executive and, in particular, to indicate what consequences
this has on the exercise of trade union rights.

(c)
The Committee draws aspects of the case relating to the Labour Amendment
Act to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of
Conventions and Recommendations.
(d)
The Committee expresses the hope that, in relation to the recognition
of sole bargaining rights, the Government will find it possible to give
effect to the principle that it is not necessarily incompatible with Convention
No. 87 to provide for certification of the most representative union in
a given bargaining unit as the exclusive bargaining agent, but that in
such cases there is a need to provide for certain safeguards which include
(a) certification by an independent body and (b) the choice of the representative
organisation by a majority vote of the employees in the unit concerned.

Case No. 1333

COMPLAINT PRESENTED BY THE WORLD FEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF JORDAN

	846.	The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) submitted a complaint
of violations of trade union rights against the Government of Jordan on
30 April 1985.   The Government sent its observations in a communication
dated 28 May 1985.

	847.	Jordan has not ratified the Freedom of Association and the Right
to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87);  it has ratified the Protection
of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No.
98).

A.
The complainant's allegations

	848.	In its communication of 30 April 1985, the WFTU states that, on 14 February
1985, government forces arrested Mohammad Hussein Qasem, President of the
General Federation of Commercial, Shops and Professional Trades Unions.
It also alleges that, on 13 April 1984, government forces arrested Abdul
Razzaq Said Issa, the General-Secretary of the Trade Union of Workers in
Banks and Insurance, for trade union activities.   According to the WFTU,
the case of Mr. Said Issa has not been referred to the courts.

	849.	The complainant states that these acts constitute grave violations
of trade union rights as enshrined in Conventions Nos. 87 and 98 and requests
action towards their unconditional release and full respect of fundamental
trade union rights in Jordan.

B.
The Government's reply

	850.	In its communication of 28 May 1985, the Government states that Mr. Mohammad
Hussein Qasem ceased to be a trade union representative on 12 January 1984
both as regards the Trade Union Committee of Workers in Furniture and Household
Appliances Industries and the Board of the General Union of Workers in
Commercial, Personal and Private Handicraft Shops to which he had previously
been affiliated.   The Government points out that the General Union of
Workers in Commercial, Personal and Private Handicraft Shops is composed
of three trade union committees (the Trade Union Committee of Workers in
Furniture and Household Appliances Industries, the Trade Union Committee
of Workers in Footwear Industries and Leather Industries, and the Trade
Union Committee of Workers in Sewing Industries) all of which nominate
three members to the nine-man board of the general union.   According to
the Government, on 19 November 1983 the Ministry of Labour and Social Development
received a memorandum from the Trade Union Committee of Workers in Furniture
and Household Appliances Industries stating that the number of candidates
for membership of that trade union committee was nine and that they had
been elected without a vote.   Mr. Qasem, not having presented himself
as a candidate, was consequently not a member of that committee.   Moreover,
on 12 January 1984, the Ministry received a memorandum from the same trade
union committee stating that Mr. Qasem was excluded from the board of the
union for various defamatory acts and the circulation of false rumours.
The Government therefore concludes that, since the arrest of Mr. Qasem
took place in February 1985, it could not have been related to his trade
union activities in which he ceased to play any role sometime before.

	851.	According to the Government, information from competent security
sources states that the arrest of Mr. Qasem was due to his activities as
a leader of the underground Popular Front/Jordan Branch which, according
to its rules was aimed at overthrowing the Jordanian regime by use of force.
Mr. Qasem was brought before the competent tribunal, given the possibility
of defending himself, found guilty and sentenced to five years' imprisonment.
The Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Social Development
is no longer responsible for the follow-up of his case.

	852.	As regards Mr. Said Issa, the Government states that he is a member
of the board of the Union of Workers in Banks, Insurance Companies and
Accounting to which he was elected in 1983.   On 18 April 1985, the Ministry
of Labour and Social Development was informed by that union of his arrest
on 14 April, without mentioning the reasons for his arrest.   According
to authorised security sources, Mr. Said Issa was arrested for being a
member of the underground Popular Front/Jordan Branch.   He was brought
before the competent tribunal, given the possibility of defending himself,
found guilty and sentenced to five years' imprisonment.   The Ministry
of Labour and Social Development is no longer responsible for following
up his case.

C.
The Committee's conclusions

	853.	The Committee notes that this case concerns the arrest - in April
1984 and February 1985 - of two trade union leaders and their subsequent
sentencing to five years' imprisonment.   It notes, in particular, that
the reasons given for the arrests and imprisonment are directly contradictory:
the complainant organisation alleges that they were due to the trade union
activities of the persons concerned, and the Government states that they
were due to their membership of an underground organisation aimed at overthrowing
the Government by force.   Although the complainant itself gives no further
details concerning the link between these persons' trade union activities
and their arrests, the Government also does not give sufficient detail
concerning the charges brought against them and does not supply a copy
of the judgement handed down by the courts involved.

	854.	Given the conflicting nature of the complainant's allegation and
the Government's reply, and while regretting the absence of more detailed
information, the Committee would recall in general that in cases such as
this involving the arrest, detention and sentencing of trade union officials,
it has always taken the view that individuals have the right to be presumed
innocent until found guilty.   Moreover, it has considered that it is incumbent
upon the Government to show that the measures involved were no way occasioned
by the trade union activities of the individuals concerned [see, for example,
112th Report, Case No. 569 (Chad), para. 185 and 234th Report, Case No.
1246 (Bangladesh), para. 71].

	855.	The Committee further notes that the Government denies that one of
the persons mentioned by the complainant organisation - Mr. Qasem - held
trade union office at the time of his arrest in February 1985.   The Committee
would recall in this connection that protection against anti-union discrimination
applies equally to trade union members and former trade union officials
as to current trade union leaders.   Nevertheless, in accordance with its
normal practice in cases where complainants allege that trade union leaders
or workers have been arrested for trade union activities and the government's
reply amounts to general denials of the allegation or is simply to the
effect that the arrests were for subversive activities, for reasons of
internal security or for common law crimes, the Committee requests the
Government to supply further and as precise information as possible concerning
the arrests, the legal proceedings that took place and the court judgement
which resulted in sentences of five years' imprisonment for both Mr. Qasem
and Mr. Said Issa.   [See, for example, 93rd Report, Cases Nos. 409 and
457 (Bolivia), para. 230.]   Once in possession of this information, the
Committee will be in a position to reach a decision in this case.

The Committee's recommendations

	856.	In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body
to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:

(a)
the Committee notes the contradictory nature of the complainant's allegations
and the Government's reply concerning the arrest of two trade union leaders
in April 1984 and February 1985 respectively;  it recalls that it is incumbent
upon the Government to show that the measures taken were in no way occasioned
by the trade union activities of the individuals concerned;

(b)
given the lack of information concerning the reasons for the arrest
and subsequent sentencing to five years' imprisonment of the trade union
leaders concerned, the Committee requests the Government to submit further
and as precise information as possible on the incidents which led to the
arrests and a copy of the judgement handed down in the subsequent proceedings,
so as to enable it to reach a decision in this case.

Geneva, 7 November 1985.	Roberto Ago,
				Chairman.


242nd REPORT

INTRODUCTION

	1.	The Committee on Freedom of Association, set up by the Governing Body
at its 117th Session (November 1951), met at the International Labour Office,
Geneva, on 1, 2, 4 and 7 November 1985 under the chairmanship of Mr. Roberto
Ago, former Chairman of the Governing Body.

	2.	The Committee had before it various complaints of infringements of
trade union rights in Turkey presented by a number of trade union organisations
(Cases Nos. 997, 999 and 1029), as well as a representation concerning
the non-observance by Turkey of the Right of Association (Agriculture)
Convention, 1921 (No. 11), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining
Convention, 1949 (No. 98), made by the General Confederation of Trade Unions
of Norway under article 24 of the Constitution of the ILO.

	3.	At its 230th Session (May-June 1985) the Governing Body adopted the
interim conclusions on Cases Nos. 997, 999 and 1029 submitted to it by
the Committee in its 240th Report.

	4.	Since then, the Government sent its observations in four communications
dated 19 September and 5, 18 and 23 October 1985.

Cases Nos. 997, 999 and 1029

CONFEDERATION OF FREE TRADE UNIONS AND SEVERAL OTHER TRADE
UNION ORGANISATIONS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY
REPRESENTATION SUBMITTED BY THE GENERAL CONFEDERATION OF
NORWEGIAN TRADE UNIONS UNDER ARTICLE 24 OF THE CONSTITUTION,
CONCERNING NON-OBSERVANCE OF THE RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION
(AGRICULTURE) CONVENTION, 1921 (NO. 11), AND THE
RIGHT TO ORGANISE AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
CONVENTION, 1949 (NO. 98) BY TURKEY

	5.	The Committee has been examining these cases since February 1981 and
has submitted 12 interim reports thereon to the Governing


 See page 1, footnote 1.
Body, the last one being submitted in May-June 1985 [see 240th Report of
the Committee, approved by the Governing Body at its 230th Session, May-June
l985].

	6.	Further allegations were contained in a communication dated 26 June 1985
from the World Federation of Trade Unions and 29 July 1985 from the Automotive
Production, Assembly, Iron, Machinery and Metal Goods Workers' Union of
Turkey (Otomobil-Is).

	7.	Further information was received from the Government in communications
dated 19 September 5, 18 and 23 October 1985.

	8.	Turkey has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of
the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87);  it has ratified the Right
to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).

A.
Previous examination of the cases

	9.	When the Committee last examined these cases in May 1985, it had received
a communication from the Government which dealt in detail with the following
matters:  the martial law situation, including the lifting of the state
of siege in various parts of the country, and the lifting of restrictions
on the right to strike and lock-out thereunder;  the trials of trade unionists,
including those of the leaders of the DISK and its affiliates;  the position
relating to five of the DISK accused who were in custody;  the question
of the treatment of prisoners while in custody;  a statutory prohibition
(in terms of transitional section 5 of Act No. 2821) on the resumption
by trade union leaders of their activities while they are on trial;   the
conservation and preservation of the assets of the trade union organisations,
including DISK, which had been suspended;  opportunities for re-employment
of trade unionists who had been detained;  and matters concerning the legislation
on trade unions, collective bargaining, strikes and lock-outs (Acts Nos.
2821 and 2822).

	10.	The Committee also had before it further information communicated
by the World Federation of Trade Unions concerning the number of persons
on trial and facing a possible death sentence, as well as two new trials
which were alleged to have been instituted in January 1985 involving officials
of the Progressive Metalworkers' Union (Dev-Mad-Sen) and the Movie Industry
Employees' Union (Sine-Sen).

	11.	In these circumstances, the Committee made the following recommendations
to the Governing Body:

(a)
The Committee expresses its appreciation for the way in which the Government
of Turkey has provided detailed observations on the matters raised in the
previous report on these cases, as well as
for the co-operation which the
Government has continued to exhibit in response to the concerns of the
Committee.

(b)
The Committee notes that martial law is still in force in at least one-third
of the provinces of Turkey (in the form of either a state of siege or a
state of emergency).   Recalling the principle that the existence of martial
law is incompatible with the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee
hopes that further developments will take place without the limitations
arising from martial law.   The Committee, accordingly, trusts that martial
law will soon be lifted in those provinces where it is still in force.

(c)
As regards the allegations received concerning the commencement of two
new trials in January 1985 involving leaders of the Progressive Metalworkers'
Union and the Movie Industry Employees' Union, the Committee requests the
Government to supply information concerning this matter.

(d)
Regarding the trial of the leaders of the DISK and its affiliates, the
Committee notes with concern that these proceedings are now in their fourth
year and feels obliged to observe that so long a period might in itself
give rise to suffering on the part of the accused persons and their families,
whatever the outcome of the proceedings.

(e)
The Committee expresses the hope that every effort will be made to bring
the trials of the DISK leaders to a speedy end and that the Government
will provide more specific information concerning the five accused in the
DISK trial who are still in detention.

(f)
The Committee expresses the hope that the Government will keep it informed
of the outcome of the appointment of a multi-party commission by the Turkish
National Assembly to investigate prison conditions and that it will provide
it with the text of any report produced by the commission.

(g)
The Committee reiterates its previous recommendation strongly urging
the Government to repeal transitional section 5 of Act No. 2821 on trade
unions, which has had the effect of prohibiting the DISK leaders from resuming
or participating in trade union activities and has thus deprived them over
a long period not only of their rights as trade union leaders but also
of their means of livelihood.

(h)
The Committee notes that the information concerning the assets of the
DISK and its affiliates does not specify the date(s) in respect of which
this information is provided, and accordingly requests the Government to
let it have the relevant figures for each of the years since the assets
were placed under trusteeship.   The Committee again expresses the wish
that steps will be taken to restore the assets of the DISK and its
affiliates
to the organisations as soon as their suspension has been lifted.

(i)
The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments
regarding the introduction of amendments to Act No. 2821 on trade unions
and Act No. 2822 on collective bargaining, strikes and lock-outs, particularly
in so far as these relate to the determination of the most representative
union for collective bargaining purposes and any limitations which might
be placed on the right of workers' organisations to participate freely
in the process of collective bargaining;  it trusts that the introduction
of such measures will result in a greater degree of conformity with the
principles of freedom of association and free collective bargaining, and
that any new legislation will take full account of the comments previously
made by the Committee and by the Committee of Experts on the Application
of Conventions and Recommendations;  it again draws this aspect of the
cases to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of
Conventions and Recommendations.

B.
Additional allegations

	12.	In its communication of 26 June 1985, the WFTU alleges (1) that a
statement by the Prime Minister of Turkey contained in an interview published
on 8-9 June 1985 in the
International Herald Tribune
violated decisions
concerning freedom of association as well as section 138 of the Turkish
Constitution in claiming that the DISK, while posing as a social-democrat
organisation, had been financed by communists, thus influencing the proceedings
at present before the courts;  and (2) the enactment of new legislation
on 16 June conferring additional repressive powers on the police which
affect trade union rights and democratic freedoms by giving power to the
administrative authorities and the police to suspend and/or close down
trade union offices.

	13.	In a communication dated 29 July 1985, Otomobil-Is (the Automotive
Production, Assembly, Iron, Steel, Machinery and Metal Goods Workers' Union
of Turkey) alleges the infringement of the exercise of trade union rights
through the refusal by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to accord
it a certificate of competence for the purposes of collective bargaining
in terms of Act No. 2822 on collective bargaining, strikes and lock-outs,
in particular through a Decree of 9 July 1985 extending the operation of
a collective agreement at the Eregli Iron and Steel Factory (ERDEMIR).

	14.	Otomobil-Is states that official statistics published as recently
as 17 July 1985 show that it is the second largest union in the metal products
industry and that it is one of five independent unions representing at
least 10 per cent of insured workers in a given branch of activity;  that
the requirement concerning representation of
at least 10 per cent of the
workers in a given branch of activity is contrary to free trade unionism,
is anti-democratic and is to the disadvantage of trade unions which, like
it, lack good relations with those exercising political power;  that it
represents a majority of the workers of ERDEMIR;  and that the Extension
Decree reflects this hostile attitude on the part of the Government while
also leaving thousands of workers at ERDEMIR who are its members unorganised.

C.
The Government's replies

	15.	In its communication of 19 September 1985, the Government, after again
expressing its satisfaction that the Committee had recognised the spirit
of co-operation it had displayed, provided further information relating
to the states of siege.   It pointed out that these could be proclaimed
only for a period not exceeding six months, and that decisions relating
to their proclamation, prolongation, shortening or lifting were required
to be submitted to the Parliament for approval.   It also stated that the
state of siege had been lifted in a further six provinces (including Ankara
and Izmir) on 19 July 1985, so that it applied now to only 17 provinces
of the total of 67 in Turkey.   The reply went on to state again that it
was the policy of the Government to proceed progressively with the lifting
of states of siege to the extent that circumstances permit and, adding
once more information to the effect that the requirement of permission
for strikes and lock-outs had been lifted since November 1984.

	16.	As regards the allegations relating to further trials said to have
been commenced in January 1985, the Government stated that the trial of
the Movie Industry Employees' Union (Sine-Sen) had been instituted at the
end of 1983 by the martial law prosecutor of Istanbul on a charge of breaching
section 141 of the Penal Code by conducting illegal activities with the
object of establishing the hegemony of one social class over another, under
cover of the trade union.

	17.	On the subject of the DISK trial(s), the Government indicated that
these were at the stage where evidence was being examined and would shortly
be entering the phase during which supplementary information would be considered;
and that, as previously stated, there was no way in which a trial could
be prolonged once the set procedures had been completed.

	18.	On the subject of the five trade unionists still in detention, the
Government provided the following information:  Mustafa Aktulgali and Ozcan Kesgeç
(of the Turkish Workers' Party) had been sentenced to eight years' imprisonment
for contravention of article 141 of the Turkish Penal Code;  Mustafa Orhan
was still on trial for contravening various articles of the Penal Code
as a member of an illegal organisation (THKP-C/Kurtulus);  Mustafa Karadayi
and Kamil
Deriner's files had been referred to the Assize Court at Ankara
on 21 May 1985, after the martial law court had been found incompetent
to deal with the charge of smuggling which they faced.

	19.	The parliamentary committee whose establishment, for the purpose of
inquiring into conditions in civil and military prisons, had been notified
to the Committee by the Government previously, has, the Government states,
recently decided to extend its programme of visits to include police stations
and places of detention.   The Committee's request for a copy of the report
of the parliamentary committee had been passed on to the President of the
Council, and the outcome would be communicated to the Committee in due
course.

	20.	After restating information to the effect that no trade unionist in
Turkey had been put on trial for legal trade union activities and that
the Constitution forbids any interference with the course of justice, the
Government goes on to indicate the origin and basis for transitional section
5 of Act No. 2821 as being articles 13 and 52 of the Constitution;  and
states that should the accused persons be acquitted they may resume their
trade union activities.   It refers to the fact that the MISK leaders who
were also accused of crimes against the State and who were acquitted thereof
today enjoy all the trade union rights recognised under the Turkish Constitution
and laws.

	21.	Concerning the assets of the DISK and its affiliates, the Government
provides figures relating to the liquid and other assets of each of 41
trade union organisations listed in its communication, which together total
approximately TL7.75 billion (or approximately US$15 million).   It states
that if the judgement of the courts permit the re-establishment of the
trade union on trial, the assets will be returned to them by the curators
who at present have the responsibility for conserving and preserving them.

	22.	In its reply of 23 October 1985, the Government states that the passages
from the Prime Minister's interview in the
International Herald Tribune
cited by the WFTU deliberately omitted a sentence at the end which read:
"But this is for the courts to decide", and again states that courts and
judges cannot receive instructions from any organ, office, agency or individual.

	23.	After describing the objects of the laws on industrial relations and
collective bargaining as well as reaffirming its attachment to international
labour standards, the reply of the Government also indicates that there
is regular co-operation between the Government and employers' and workers'
organisations and that the continuing work on the formulation of amendments
to Acts Nos. 2821 and 2822 takes account of the views of these organisations
and of the universities.

	24.	Concerning the allegation by the WFTU regarding the introduction of
new powers for the police in terms of legislation enacted in June 1985,
the Government, in its communication of
23 October, states that the pre-existing
law (Act No. 2559, dating from 1934) was inadequate to deal with developments
over the last 50 years.   It confirms that the new law, Act No. 3233 of
16 June 1985, refers in section 8E to the premises of trade unions as among
those which may be closed down or withdrawn from use after more than one
written warning by the police where they are not being operated in accordance
with their stated purpose.   It adds that the new law retains safeguards
which were in the previous legislation (the requirement that the police
should act on the basis of evidence;  that they should act on the instructions
of the highest local administrative authority, i.e. governors and district
governors;  and that, if the reasons for the police action could give rise
to legal proceedings, the judicial authorities must be informed immediately),
while introducing the following additional elements:  reducing the time
for which premises can be closed down in circumstances involving legal
proceedings from an unlimited period to a maximum of three months;  guaranteeing
the right of appeal to the Council of State at any stage of administrative
and judicial proceedings related to action by the police in terms of the
provision.

	25.	In its communication of 18 October 1985 relating to the allegations
of Otomobil-Is, the Government explains that the collective agreement was
extended by decree in order not to deprive the workers at ERDEMIR of its
benefits and to avoid the unfortunate effects which this might have on
productivity in an enterprise of considerable importance within the national
economy.   This had become necessary because it had become clear that none
of the three unions which are engaged in activities at ERDEMIR (i.e., Celik-Is,
Otomobil-Is and Turk Metal) could obtain the required majority at the place
of work, since, in terms of sections 22 and 25 of Act No. 2821 on trade
unions, new members of one union could only be acquired as a result of
resignations from either of the other two;  and that even if this were
to occur, the process would take considerable time.   The Government also
indicates that at the time of their respective applications for certificates
of competence, both Celik-Is and Otomobil-Is were adjudged to have less
than the required number of members at the workplace (1,053 out of 7,693
in the case of the former, and 1,687 out of 7,888 for the latter);  and
that these judgements had been confirmed on appeal by the Labour Court
of Zongulak in both instances and, so far as Otomobil-Is is concerned,
also by the Court of Cassation.

D.
The conclusions of the Committee

	26.	The Committee notes the detailed information supplied by the Government
in response to the recommendations it made in its previous report.   It
feels bound, however, to observe that although developments are to be noted
in regard to some of the matters on which it has made recommendations,
it is a matter of regret that it is still necessary to address a significant
number of the issues with which the
cases have been concerned over a period
of nearly five years.   The process of arriving at conclusions on some
of the outstanding problems might be aided if additional new information
were available, especially as regards a number of specific matters to which
attention has been directed.

	27.	The Committee notes with interest that the Government has taken further
steps to lift the state of siege in a number of provinces.   It notes,
however, that martial law still operates in this form in 17 of Turkey's
67 provinces.   It once again expresses the firm hope that steps will be
taken to remove martial law completely since its continued existence is,
in the opinion of the Committee, incompatible with the exercise of trade
union rights.

	28.	The Committee is also of the view that the continuation of the trial
of the leaders of the DISK and its affiliates remains a matter for disquiet,
and it expresses the hope that every effort will be made to bring it to
a speedy end.

	29.	As regards those trade unionists who are in detention, the Committee
notes that the trial of two of these has been referred from a military
to a civil court, and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments
in these proceedings so that it may satisfy itself that the offences with
which they are charged do not relate to the trade union activities of these
persons.   Similarly, it requests the Government to supply it with copies
of the judgements in respect of the other three persons who have received
sentences of imprisonment for the purpose of arriving at a conclusion on
their cases in full possession of all relevant information.

	30.	The Committee takes note of the Government's statement that no new
trial was instituted in January 1985 in respect of leaders of the Movie
Industry Employees' Union, but that this was in fact commenced at the end
of 1983.   It trusts that it will be kept informed of developments in this
respect, as in the case of other trials involving trade unionists and trade
union leaders.   At the same time the Committee notes that no reference
was made in the reply of the Government to allegations concerning the trial
of 16 leaders of the Progressive Metalworkers' Union (Dev-Maden-Is), and
requests the Government to supply it with information on this matter.

	31.	The Committee notes with interest that the parliamentary committee
of inquiry into conditions in civil and military prisons is extending its
investigations to cover police stations and other places of detention under
the supervision of the police;  it expresses the hope that the Government
will make available to it a copy of the report presented on these and other
aspects of allegations relating to the torture and ill-treatment of prisoners.

	32.	The Committee remains of the view that the prohibition contained in
transitional section 5 of Act No. 2821 involves an infringement of freedom
of association by depriving trade unionists and trade union leaders of
the right to participate in trade union
activities while they are on trial
and in the absence of conviction of any offence.   It expresses the hope
that the necessary steps will be aken to repeal the provision and to ensure
that the trade unionists and trade union leaders involved will be able
to enjoy all the rights to which they are entitled in accordance with the
principles of freedom of association.

	33.	The Committee notes the information provided by the Government concerning
the assets of the DISK and its affiliates.   In this regard it must point
out that, although this contains more detail as to the position of individual
unions, it still does not indicate a basis on which an assessment can be
made as to the extent to which the assets have been preserved, as no comparative
figures are given for the dates on which possession was taken by the curators
or in respect of subsequent years.   Compared with information made available
to the Committee by the Government at the time of its last report, the
totals of the sums involved as referred to in the information provided
in its communication of 19 September 1985 indicate that there may have
been a substantial diminution in the value of the assets.   The Committee
must, in the circumstances, urge the Government to supply it with complete
and comprehensive information on the position so that it may reach a conclusion
on this aspect of the case in full possession of all the relevant facts.

	34.	The Committee takes note of the allegation concerning statements by
the Prime Minister which might influence the proceedings of the court and
of the information provided by the Government to the effect that this was
qualified by specific mention of the fact that it was for the courts to
decide on the matters referred to, as well as its affirmation that courts
and judges may not receive orders and instructions from any organ, office,
agency or individual.   In the circumstances, it is of the view that this
question does not require further examination.

	35.	On the subject of the allegations concerning the powers accorded to
the police in terms of Act No. 3233, the Committee takes note of the information
supplied by the Government.   At the same time it notes that no specific
allegations have been made concerning the use of these powers against trade
unions or trade union premises.   The Committee nevertheless expresses
the hope that they will not be so used or otherwise employed in a manner
which would involve an infringement of the principles of freedom of association.

	36.	The Committee takes note of the Government's explanation of the reasons
for the refusal of a certificate of competence to Otomobil-Is in terms
of Act No. 2822 on collective bargaining, strikes and lock-outs.   It also
notes, however, that the legislative provisions restricting recognition
to unions which have a minimum of 50 per cent of workers in a bargaining
unit have been the subject of criticism by the Committee of Experts on
the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, which pointed out that
if there is no union covering more than 50 per cent of the workers, collective
bargaining rights should be granted to all the unions in a particular
unit,
at least on behalf of their own members.   The Committee therefore once
again draws the legislative aspect of the case to the attention of the
Committee of Experts.

	37.	The Committee notes from the reply of the Government that the process
of formulating amendments to Acts Nos. 2821 and 2822 on industrial relations
and collective bargaining is still continuing and trusts that in this regard
account will be taken of the previous comments made by the Committee on
these matters.   It requests the Government to keep it informed of developments
in this regard, and draws the matter to the attention of the Committee
of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.

The Committee's recommendations

	38.	The Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim
report and, in particular, the following conclusions:

(a)
The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government in response
to its previous recommendations;  it expresses regret, however, that it
is still necessary to address a significant number of the issues with which
the cases have been concerned over a period of nearly five years.

(b)
The Comittee notes with interest that the Government has taken further
measures to lift the state of siege in a number of provinces and expresses
the firm hope that steps will be taken to remove martial law completely
since its continued existence is, in its opinion, incompatible with the
exercise of trade union rights.

(c)
The Committee is also of the view that the continuation of the trial
of the leaders of the DISK and its affiliates remains a matter for disquiet
and expresses the hope that every effort will be made to bring it to a
speedy end.

(d)
The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments
concerning the proceedings against two of the trade union leaders under
detention whose trial has been transferred from a military to a civil court
so that it may be satisfied that the offences with which they are charged
do not relate to the trade union activities of those persons.

(e)
The Committee also requests the Government to supply it with copies
of the judgements in respect of the other three trade unionists who have
been sentenced to periods of imprisonment, for the purpose of arriving
at a conclusion on their cases in full possession of all relevant information.

(f)
The Committee requests the Government to supply it with information
relating to the trial of 16 officials of the Progressive Metalworkers'
Union (Dev-Maden-Is).

(g)
The Committee requests the Government to make available to it a copy
of the report presented by the parliamentary committee of inquiry relating
to conditions in civil and military prisons and other aspects of allegations
relating to the torture and ill-treatment of prisoners.

(h)
The Committee urges the Government to supply it with complete and comprehensive
information relating to the assets of the DISK and its affiliates, and
in particular repeats its request that the relevant figures be made available
in respect of each of the years since the assets were placed under trusteeship.

(i)
The Committee expresses the hope that the new powers accorded to the
police in terms of Act No. 3233 of 16 June 1985 will not be used against
trade unions or trade union premises or in any other way which would involve
an infringement of the principles of freedom of association.

(j)
The Committee expresses the hope that the necessary steps will be taken
to repeal transitional section 5 of Act No. 2821 and to ensure that the
trade unionists and trade union leaders who have been deprived of the right
to participate in trade union activities while they are on trial and who
have not been convicted of any offence are thereby afforded the rights
to which they are entitled in accordance with the principles of freedom
of association.

(k)
The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments
concerning the formulation of amendments to Acts Nos. 2821 and 2822 and
trusts that, in this regard, account will be taken of the previous comments
made by the Committee on these matters.   It draws this aspect of the cases
to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions
and Recommendations.
